MEL Genealogy Key (MELGenKey) Overview
v20250926

(NOTE - MELGenKey is a work-in-progress. This Overview is written with the idea in mind of how MELGenKey will look when completed. Not all
the capabilities of MELGenKey are currently available.)

MELGenKey, a Genealogist Assistant Program, is a "Full Stack" application meaning that there is both a client-side (front end, browser)
and a server-side (back end, data storage and modification). There's no need to understand "Full Stack"; just understand that both the
client-side and the server-side (i.e., the entire application) will reside on the same computer. MELGenKey is written in HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. It should execute fine as is on most all platforms/environments.

In general, MELGenKey allows the user to organize data, verify data, manipulate data, utilize data in various ways, and unlock new data.

One of the main objectives of MELGenKey is to bring together in one place all functions and utilities which can aid a genealogist in his
or her quest.

MELGenKey relies upon a specific format for the genealogical data. (See the menu item "Help/Info/Docs -&gt; Data Format and Notes" for
an explanation of the format of the data.) This format makes the data human-readable and at the same time computer-processable. A
disadvantage is that the data may be more difficult to maintain by hand. The ability to automatically translate data from Gedcom format
to MELGenKey format alleviates much of the difficulty. (See
"Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase -> Import a Family DataBase from a GEDCOM".)

There's no need to access the Internet to make use of MELGenKey, but you can. This means that MELGenKey can be used either on-line or
off-line. During on-line usage MELGenKey has the ability to access Web sites extending it's capability. For example, sites such as
Ancestry, FamilySearch, Wikitree, MyHeritage, gedmatch, findagrave, etc may be accessed by MELGenKey (your login and password for each
may be needed in some cases; e.g., when modifying data) searching for additional info to aid your research.

MELGenKey does NOT need to be in an area accessible to your Web server, if you are running a Web server, unless you want to allow remote
users access to your data.

A browser is needed to run MELGenKey. Some browsers are:
  Firefox ( https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ )
  Opera ( https://www.opera.com/ )
  Chrome ( https://www.google.com/chrome/ )
  Vivaldi ( https://vivaldi.com/ )
  et al

  Note - Internet Explorer has not been maintained for a while and probably won't work correctly with MELGenKey.

nodejs (AKA, node.js, node) is needed to make full use of MELGenKey. nodejs may come installed by default on your system. To check if
nodejs is installed, open the command-line program for your OS (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, or Terminal on both MacOS and Linux).
Type "node -v" (without the quotes), and press RETURN. This will display your nodejs version if it is installed. If not, follow these
installation instructions:

for Linux:
  in the command-line program (Terminal) enter:
    sudo apt install nodejs (and press RETURN)
    sudo apt install npm (and press RETURN)
for Apple Mac:
  use a browser to go to https://nodejs.org/en/
  download the macOS Installer
  run the macOS Installer
for Microsoft Windows:
  use a browser to go to https://nodejs.org/en/
  download the Windows Installer
    (download the correct version ... 32 bit or 64 bit ... depending upon your system)
  run the Windows Installer

Several nodejs external libraries are needed to run MELGenKey. They are installed during the MELGenKey installation process.



MEL Genealogy Key (MELGenKey) Installation
v20250926

General Notes:
These instructions are for Windows, macOS or Linux. MELGenKey should run on all three platforms.

The words node, node.js and nodejs are used interchangeably to refer to the JavaScript runtime environment (usually referred to as nodejs).

Prerequisites:
You should have a basic understanding of using a command prompt/terminal.


1.  Open the command-line program for your OS (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, and Terminal on both MacOS and Linux).

      To bring up the Command Prompt on Windows:
      (1) Open the Start menu.
      (2) Select All Programs.
      (3) Select Accessories.
      (4) Select Command Prompt.

      To bring up the PowerShell on Windows:
      (1) Click Start.
      (2) Type PowerShell.
      (3) Click Windows PowerShell.

      OR

      (1) From the Start menu, click Start.
      (2) Click All Programs.
      (3) Click Accessories.
      (4) Click the Windows PowerShell folder.
      (5) Click Windows PowerShell.

2.  Type "node -v" (without the quotes) and press RETURN. If nodejs is already installed you will see its version number on the screen,
    go to Step 4.

3.  If nodejs is NOT already installed:
      3a.  Download the correct installer from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ for your system (Windows Installer (.msi) for Windows or macOS
           Installer (.pkg) for macOS or Linux Binaries for Linux).
      3b.  Run the installer by double-clicking on the installer icon or, for Linux, install the binaries. For installation help on Linux,
           see https://github.com/nodejs/help/wiki/Installation
      3c.  Type "npm install npm --global" (without the quotes) and press RETURN.
      3d.  Type "node -v" (without the quotes) and press RETURN. If nodejs is installed you will see the version number on the screen.

4.  Create the folder/directory where MELGenKey will reside. This might be a folder/directory within your home folder/directory. (MELGenKey
    does NOT need to be in an area accessible to your Web server, if you are running a Web server.)

5.  Download the MELGenKey zip file, and unzip the contents into the folder/directory created in Step 4. After unzipping is completed, and
    if you like, remove the MELGenKey zip file.

8.  While still in the MELGenKey root directory created in Step 4, type "npm install" (without the quotes) and press RETURN.


At this point everything should be installed.


To run:

1.  While still in the MELGenKey root directory created in Step 4 above, type "node MELGenKeySS.js" (without the quotes) and press RETURN.

2.  From your desktop, double-click on the icon labeled "MELGenKey.html" (without the quotes).

    OR

    From your desktop, right-click on the icon labeled "MELGenKey.html" (without the quotes), then left click on Open.

    OR

    In the address line in your browser of choice enter the proper address to access MELGenKey.html in the MELGenKey root directory.



Additional notes:

    Security: If you are running a Web server and MELGenKey is in an area accessible by the Web server, turn off outside access to the
              folder/directory created in Step 4 above.
    Troubleshooting: If you have issues installing, email me at MarshallELake@gmail.com
    Documentation: Documentation for MELGenKey is accessible from within the application itself.

If nothing happens when clicking an enabled menu button in MELGenKey it is probably because of an ad-blocker or because pop-ups are blocked
in your browser settings. (NOTE - There are no ads in MELGenKey, but there are pop-ups which an ad-blocker might block.)

If the node/server is not recognized, not connected or doesn't seem to be running (even though you know it is), it may be because of an
ad-blocker. (NOTE - There are no ads in MELGenKey, but there are pop-ups which an ad-blocker might block.) Ad-Blockers are built into some
browsers. For example, if you are using the Brave browser, go to Settings -> Shields and disable "Trackers & ads blocking" to turn off
ad-blocking.

Node may be left running in the background if you like, and, in fact, you may want to do this if using functions to monitor changes in Web
sites or running recurring reports, both of which use cron jobs in their processing. For Windows, MacOS, or Linux, to run the server in the
background, using a command-line program while in the MELGenKey root folder/directory created in Step 4 above, type "node MELGenKeySS.js &"
(without the quotes) and press RETURN.

Node is the part of this application which accesses files and performs other functions which the browser is not able to do.

The browser side (MELGenKey.html) may be run without node running but functionality will be limited.
