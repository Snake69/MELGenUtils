<a id="q1">How to display the Plain Text version of a Family DataBase</a>
<ol>
<pre>
NOTE - There are no functional "clickable links" in the plain text version of a Family DataBase; this makes the HTML version of a
       Family DataBase better and easier for viewing on a computer in many instances.

If a Family DataBase is already included with MELGenUtils, skip to Step 2.

If you have a GEDCOM file, skip to "Import a GEDCOM file -" in Step 1.

</pre>

           fill in the ensuing form following the instructions on the form

           error messages and/or informational messages may be displayed; any fatal errors need to be fixed before the Family DataBase can be
             successfully imported
               if you need more help, click "Help/Info/Docs" on the Main Menu, then click "Using MELGenUtils", then click

           click "Import, Create or Remove a Family DataBase" on the Main Menu
           click "Create HTML Version of Family DataBase" and follow the instructions on the screen
           click the button labeled "Continue" to start the HTML creation process
           error messages and/or informational messages may be displayed or referenced; any fatal errors need to be fixed before the
             HTML version of the Family DataBase can be successfully created; there may also be non-fatal errors which do not stop the
             HTML version of the Family DataBase from being created
               if you need more help, click "Help/Info/Docs" on the Main Menu, then click "Using MELGenUtils", then click
                 "Create HTML Version of Family DataBase"
               if you still need more help, click "Help/Info/Docs" on the Main Menu, then click "Contact Developer of MELGenUtils via email"

</pre>
<li>View HTML version of the Family DataBase -</li>
<pre>
           click "Display Family Data" on the Main Menu
           click "HTML Family Data"
           a list of files and/or directories/folders will be shown on the screen
             included in the list should be one or more "body.html" files with an included sequential number, a tableofcontents.html file,
               and an index.html file if it exists
             click on tableofcontents.html to see an abbreviated description of the files in the list
             the "body.html" files contain the Family History; the larger the sequential number, the more distant (time-wise) the people in that
               particular file
             the index.html file contains an index of people contained in the "body.html" files

           NOTE - There are many "clickable links" in the HTML version of the Family DataBase; this means that, for example, you may click on
                  the index.html file (if it exists) and then jump to a particular person in the Family DataBase by clicking on a reference
                  associated with the person's name in the index.html file (a person may have multiple references in the index.html file);
                  another example is clicking on a Father (in the Father line of the HOF Section) or Mother (in the Mother line of the HOF
                  Section) of an individual will jump to the parents' Family Group in the Family DataBase, continuing to click on the Father
                  or Mother in the parents' Family Group will eventually jump back to the most distant ancestor in that ancestry line.
