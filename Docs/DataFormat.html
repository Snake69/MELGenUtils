Use these formatting guidelines to create plain text files by hand for importing as a Family DataBase.


Format of a MEL Genealogy Utilities (MELGenUtils) Family DataBase

A Family DataBase consists of 1 or more Family Groups. A Family DataBase is in plain text (human readable) format.

All Family Groups consist of:
  Head of Family Section (required)
  Account Section (optional)
  Citation Section (required, minimum number of lines - 3, maximum number of lines - unlimited)
  Children Section (required, minimum number of lines - 4, maximum number of lines - unlimited)
  Delimiter Section (required, 3 lines)

Head of Family Section consists of (one Head of Family Section is required; there may be more than one):
  Line 1 (Head of Family)
    ID# followed by 2 spaces followed by name (first, middle, last - no prefixes, titles nor suffixes)
      Note - "OPEN" instead of "name" is acceptable; in this case there should be nothing else for this Family Group and Line 1 should be
             followed by the Delimiter Section
  Line 2 - literal "Father - " followed by ID# (optional, if present followed by 2 spaces) followed by name of Father (first, middle, last -
           no prefixes, titles nor suffixes) of person named on Line 1

  Line 4 - null
Note - another (one or more) Head of Family Section(s) may follow
Note - any name (except Head of Family) may be "name unknown" (without the quotes)
Note - any name may be "------ SURNAME" or "FIRSTNAME ------" (without the quotes)
       (Head of Family can be "------ SURNAME" but cannot be "FIRSTNAME ------")

               yyyy = year, b = space
             column 7 may also contain a 'c' for circa, 'd' for double date (when the date is a double date, the year should reflect
               the Julian year even if that makes the Timeline events seem out of sequence), a '<' for before or a '>' for after
             column 12 is either a space or a '-' ('-' indicates a span of time, and, if present, should be immediately followed by another date)
      Note - for a date, dd and mmm are optional, yyyy is required
      Note - if Line 2 runs into the next line, do not repeat the date and start the continuation line in column 15
      Note - Line 2 may be repeated any number of times
      Note - at least one Line 2 is required if Timeline is present

Extra notes ...

Each Family Group is a separate entity.

Each and every item in a Family Group "Account Section" (Timeline, Notes, Questions, Extras and Explanations)
and the Children Section must be cited. An "item" is generally considered a line. However, one "item" may contain multiple lines or
multiple continuation lines grouped together. One "item" may also contain multiple citations. For example, an "item" stating:

Joe Smith married Henrietta Jones; buried in Graceland Cemetery.

could look like this:

Joe Smith married Henrietta Jones; [1] [2] buried in Graceland Cemetery. [3]

Citation #1 and Citation #2 are used to show the marriage, and Citation #3 is used to show where Joe Smith is buried.


Each Family Group:

Line 1 must start in column 1 with the Family ID.  Family ID contains only
numerics and one period (.).  There must be at least 2 numerics.  The first
and last character of the Family ID must be numeric.  Family IDs must be
sequential from one family to the next.  Each Family ID is unique.

A Family ID normally looks like:
n.n

The n to the left of the period normally indicates the generation (but may not be exact).  The n
to the right of the period is a sequential identifier within that generation.

n = 1 or more numerics

The Family ID must be followed by 2 spaces which in turn is followed with
the name (first, middle, last) of the Head of the Family. The Head of the
Family is normally defined as a blood relative.

Timeline - c in column before year indicates "circa" (about)
           - in column after month indicates BCE or BC (Before Christian Era or Before Christ)
           d indicates "double date" (AKA "dual date", "double year")
             (a "dual date" can lead to an irregular sequence of dates, e.g., 13 Jand1700 falls chronologically AFTER 25 Apr 1700,
              'd' is omitted when proper year is unclear or when double date is not made clear by Source)
           &lt; indicates before
           &gt; indicates after
           date may appear only when it is not EXACTLY the same as previous date; blank date means to use previous
             date (e.g., "c1902" is not the same as "1902"), however it is not an error to have two consecutive dates exactly the same
           ? in place of a number in a date when number not known
           Timeline events are in sequence as best as can be accomplished ... the following:
                    1949 living in ...
                    1949 moved to ...
             15 Jul 1949 so and so died
                Jul 1949 obit published
             20 Jul 1949 so and so buried
                    1949 another event

             would indicate that the first and second 1949 events occurred before 15 Jul 1949, the second 1949 event occurred after the
               first 1949 event, the third 1949 event occurred after 20 Jul 1949, and the Jul 1949 event occurred between 15 Jul 1949 and
               20 Jul 1949

Timeline contains only dated events or items.  Events/items for which there is no date is placed in the Notes area.

Notes
Each person who has associated notes has a separate Note line.
Multiple notes for the same person are separated by a semicolon (;).
Notes are not in in any specified sequence.

Citation/Citations/Source/Sources
When there is more than 1 citation/source, each citation/source is numbered in the Citation Section.
Each event in the Timeline should be cited with [n] where n = the Citation number.  Each item in all other areas of the Account Section are
also cited.  An item without a Citation reference means to use the Citation Reference following the next item.  However, each individual
appearing in the Account Section must be cited at least once.


Format of the index File<br>
<br>
LastName, FirstName MiddleName  FGID ...
<br>
LastName is the person's last name. LastName must be followed by a comma and a whitespace.<br>
FirstName is the person's first name.<br>
MiddleName is the person's middle name. There can be multiple MiddleName's, or none.<br>
FirstName, if unknown, must be substituted with "------" (without the quotes).<br>
FirstName and MiddleName must be followed by a whitespace. And the final occurrence of a name on the line must be followed by two whitespaces.<br>
FGID is the Family Group ID in the Family DataBase where the name appears. There may be multiple FGID's. Each FGID except the last must be
followed by a comma and a whitespace.<br>
<br>
Note - The contents of the index file do not need to be sorted. The contents of the file will be sorted when the Family DataBase is verified
("Verify Family Data" on the main menu).<br>

Structure & Format Guidelines for the Directory/Folder Containing the User Created Files to Import ...<br>
<br>
Structure looks like:<br>
Import directory/folder
    if importing user-created files then body and/or text files (minimum - 1 file, maximum - unlimited)
    if importing a Gedcom then one (and one only) Gedcom file (with a .ged extension)
    index file 
    tableofcontents file 
    miscellaneous files (unlimited number)
    UnsureIfRelated directory/folder
        directories/folders, plain text files and/or image files (unlimited number)
    Other directory/folder
        any number of files and/or directories/folders
    Reference directory/folder
        plain text files (unlimited number)
        directory/folder (unlimited number)
    Images directory/folder
        tableofcontents file
        Biographies directory/folder
            images (unlimited number)
        Maps directory/folder
            normally would contain sub-directories/folders which indicate location (e.g., a sub-directory/folder named USA, and within USA another sub-directory/folder named NY, etc)
        Misc directory/folder
        Newspapers directory/folder
            normally would contain sub-directories/folders which indicate type (e.g., Birth, Death, Marriage, etc)
        People directory/folder
            images (unlimited number)
        Records directory/folder
            normally would contain sub-directories/folders which indicate type (e.g., Birth, Death, Marriage, etc)
<br>
The name of the Import directory/folder can be anything allowed by your operating system. Within this directory/folder will reside all the files
with which the MELGenUtils Family DataBase will be built. If importing a GEDCOM, then the GEDCOM file should be in the Import directory/folder. If
importing user-created files then "body" and/or "text" file(s) should be in the Import directory/folder as explained next. All other files and
sub-directories/folders are optional and may exist whether importing a GEDCOM or user-created files.<br>
<br>
The "Family Groups" must be in files named "body" or "text" (case insensitive) if importing from user-created files. If there is more than
one "body" and/or "text" file then there must be a sequential number attached to each file name (e.g., body1, text3, body4, etc). That
portion of the filename called "body" or "text", can be mixed, but each sequential number must be unique (e.g., there cannot be files
in the directory/folder named "body234" and "text234"). The files should be numbered sequentially in the way the data within the files should
be added to the MELGenUtils Family DataBase. For an explanation of the format of the contents of the "body" and "text" files see elsewhere in
this file.<br>
<br>
There may also be an "index" file (case insensitive). For an explanation of the format of the contents of the "index" file see elsewhere
in this file. There may also be a "tableofcontents" file (case insensitive) pertaining to the files previously mentioned. If a
"tableofcontents" file does not exist it will be created. All of the files previously mentioned are optional except there must be at least
one "body" or "text" file (if importing from user-created files) or one GEDCOM file (if importing from a GEDCOM). All the files previously
mentioned must be in the top level of the directory/folder (i.e., they cannot reside within sub-directories/folders).<br>
<br>
There may be sub-directories/folders named "UnsureIfRelated", "Other", "Images" and "Reference" (all case insensitive). "Images" normally
contains files of citation/source material in graphical form. "Reference" normally contains files of citation/source material in plain text
form. "UnsureIfRelated" normally contains files of plain text and/or image information pertaining to people who may or may not be related to
people appearing in the Family DataBase. All the aforementioned sub-directories/folders are optional. Any sub-directory/folder present will
be imported verbatim.<br>
<br>
Any file in the top level of the directory/folder which is unknown to MELGenUtils will be imported into the "Other" sub-directory/folder. Some
files that may exist in the "Other" sub-directory/folder are meaningful to MELGenUtils. These include (file names exactly as shown):<br>
AdditionalInfoNotIncluded.txt - list of people for whom there is additional info that is not included in this DataBase (e.g., this could be for living people not made public)<br>
Bibliography.txt - list of reference material used in this DataBase<br>
DBinfo.txt - info describing this DataBase (used by MELGenUtils); this file has a particular format (see elsewhere in this file for a description of the format)<br>
Dedication.txt - dedication<br>
DevHistory.txt - development history regarding this DataBase<br>
FamilyObscurities.txt - obscure info pertaining to some people and/or families appearing in this DataBase<br>
Founders.txt - list of people in this DataBase who founded something<br>

Statistics.txt - some statistics regarding this DataBase<br>
SurnameRecap.txt - general notes with regard to some surnames appearing in the DataBase<br>
UsersGuide.txt - a guide for using this DataBase<br>
<br>
If the file DBinfo.txt is not provided, it will be created by MELGenUtils. If the file DBinfo.txt is provided, info will be appended to it by
MELGenUtils. A tableofcontents file will be created for the "Other" sub-directory/folder.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Format of the DBinfo.txt File<br>
<br>
A pound sign (#) in column 1 in any line identifies that line as a comment.<br>
All fields except DBName, DBVersion and DBDescription may have multiple values; separate multiple values using a semi-colon (;).<br>
Enclose a set of values within quotes (").<br>
Do not use quotes (") within any field value.<br>
All field names and values are optional.<br>
A null field value can be shown as "".<br>
All field value lengths are unlimited.<br>
The following are all field names which are meaningful to MELGenUtils, some of which are shown with example field values. All field names
are optional. Also, if creating your own DBinfo.txt file to be imported, other field names and field values may be added to the file.
Additional fields will be appended to the file by MELGenUtils when it is imported.<br>
DBName = "Sands of Time II - KILLE"
DBVersion = "20231111"
DBDescription = "Main Surnames: Kille, Deckelmann. Main Geographical Areas: NY, Germany."
