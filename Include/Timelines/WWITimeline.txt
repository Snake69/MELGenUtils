       1914 -1918, World War I, about 15 million people died [11]
28 Jun 1914 Prince Archduke Franz Ferdinand, [1] [4] [12] (b. 1863)
              [1] heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, [1] [4] and
              his wife Sophie [1] [2] (duchess of Hohenberg, b. 1868)
              [1] was assassinated [1] [4] [12] in Sarajevo [1] [4] at
              10:45. [2] The Archduke had been on a visit to Bosnia. [2]
              The assassin was a Serbian nationalist [4] (Gavrilo Princip)
              [1] [2] whose co-conspirators were in Belgrade. The Serbians
              wanted to detach Bosnia from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. [4]
              The assassination was the casus belli of WWI. [1] [2] [12]
 5 Jul 1914 Austria-Hungary seeks German support for a war against Serbia
              in case of Russian militarism. Germany gives assurances of

23 Jul 1914 Beginning of the "Black Week". Austria-Hungary issues a series
              of demands in an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia demanding
              Serbia to allow the Austrians to determine who assassinated
              Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Serbia accepts all but one of those
              demands and Austria declares war on 28 Jul. The Serbian response
              was seen as satisfactory everywhere but in Vienna. [1]
28 Jul 1914 Austria Declares War on Serbia, [1] [4] [10] Russia mobilizes
              [1] - In the aftermath of the assassination of Archduke
              Ferdinand, Austria made ten demands of Serbia. These included the
              suppression of all publications critical of Austria-Hungary and
              the withdrawal of schoolbooks filled with propaganda against the
              Empire. Army officers, school teachers and government officials
              holding these views would have to be dismissed. Specific
              individuals would be targeted for arrest. Finally, an Austrian
              official would be appointed to monitor the fulfillment of
              these demands. The Serbians accepted all but the last demand. [4]
            The Netherlands declare neutrality. [1]

              communicate via telegram. [1]

 1 Aug 1914 Germany Declares War on the Russian Empire [1] - When the
              Russians came to the defense of the Serbs, the Germans had no
              choice but to go to war to defend their Austrian allies. Their
              strategy for war against Russia was the Schefffein Plan which
              called for an initial attack against France, Russia's ally. So,
              even though Germany had no dispute with France at the time,
              it still declared war against France. [4] France orders a
              general mobilization, [1] [5] and the first German army units
              cross into Luxembourg in preparation for the German invasion
              of France. [5] The Swiss Army mobilizes. [1]
            Italy declares its neutrality. [1]

              declares its neutrality. [1]
 4 Aug 1914 Germany invades Belgium to outflank the French army. [1] The
              German invasion plan for France called for an attack through
              Belgium, instead of through the heavily defended Franco-German
              border. Belgium was neutral and its neutrality was protected
              by treaty with Great Britain. [4]
            The United States declares its neutrality. [1] [5]
            Britain protests against the violation of Belgian neutrality,
              guaranteed by the Treaty of London. The German Chancellor
              replies that the treaty is just a chiffon de papier (a scrap of
              paper). [1] The United Kingdom declares war on Germany. [1] [6]

              Amphion. [1]

              (Australia) fire across the bows of the Norddeutscher Lloyd
              steamer SS Pfalz which is attempting to leave the Port of
              Melbourne in ignorance of the declaration of war and she is
              detained; this is said to be the first Allied shot of the
              War. [1]

              up the slack, as a "mama" voice device for dolls was invented
              by Newark's Louis K. Aronson in 1915. That year Lionel Trains
              announced that it could not make toy trains fast enough to

              from their trenches and approached the Allied lines across
              no-man's-land, calling out "Merry Christmas" in their enemies'
              native tongues. At first, the Allied soldiers feared it was
              a trick, but seeing the Germans unarmed they climbed out of
              their trenches and shook hands with the enemy soldiers. The
              men exchanged presents of cigarettes and plum puddings and sang

              on "disaffected foreigners" angered by labor issues, but many
              thought it German sabotage related to American sales of war

19 Nov 1915 The British airman Richard Bell Davies performs a daring rescue,
              swooping down in his plane to whisk a downed fellow pilot from
              behind the Turkish lines at Ferrijik Junction. A squadron
              commander in the Royal Naval Air Service, Davies was flying
              alongside Flight Sub-Lieutenant Gilbert F. Smylie on a bombing
              mission. Their target was the railway junction at Ferrijik,
              located near the Aegean Sea and the border between Bulgaria and
              Ottoman-controlled Europe. When the Turks hit Smylie's plane
              with anti-aircraft fire, he was forced to land. As he made his
              way to the ground, Smylie was able to release all his bombs
              but one before making a safe landing behind enemy lines. Smylie
              was then unable to restart his plane and immediately set fire
              to the aircraft in order to disable it. Meanwhile, Davies saw
              his comrade's distress from the air and quickly moved to land
              his own plane nearby. Seeing Davies coming to his rescue and
              fearing the remaining bomb on his plane would explode, injuring
              or killing them both, Smylie quickly took aim at his machine
              with his revolver and fired, exploding the bomb safely just
              before Davies came within its reach. Davies then rushed to
              grab hold of Smylie, hauling him on board his aircraft just
              as a group of Turkish soldiers approached. Before the Turks
              could reach them, Davies took off, flying himself and Smylie
              to safety behind British lines. Calling Davies' act a "feat
              of airmanship that can seldom have been equaled for skill and
              gallantry," the British government awarded him the Victoria
              Cross on 1 Jan 1916. The quick-thinking Smylie was rewarded
              as well; he received the Distinguished Service Cross. [5]

              of the war. [1] This battle, in the North Sea, was the only
              naval battle of the war in which the main German and British
              fleets engaged each other. Previously and subsequently,
              the naval war was a series skirmishes with German raiders
              and submarines. The British were successful in blockading the
              Germans, while the Germans were successful in blocking aid to
              the Russians and sinking a large number of British merchant
              vessels with submarines. The battle itself was a tactical
              victory for the Germans, who sunk twice as much tonnage as the
              British. The results did not change the strategic situation,
              however, and the Germans resorted to unrestricted submarine
              warfare that ultimately resulted in the US intervention. [4]

30 Jul 1916 The "Black Tom" ammunition pier on the Hudson River in Jersey
              City exploded. [1] [8] Although America was still neutral in
              World War I, large amounts of ammunition manufactured in the
              United States were shipped to the allies in Europe, and German
              saboteurs had placed bombs on the pier. [8] 7 people were
              killed. The explosion shattered windows in downtown Manhattan
              and the noise was heard as far away as Maryland. Damages totaled
              about $20-25 million. After much legal maneuvering a commission
              in 1939 ruled that Germany was guilty of sabotaging Black Tom
              and another plant in Kingsland, NJ, and awarded $50 million
              to the claimants. In 1953 the new Federal Republic of Germany

28 Jun 1919 The Treaty of Versailles [1] [4] [12] (and the Little Treaty of
              Versailles) [1] was signed, thereby officially ending World War
              I. [1] [4] [12] Under the treaty's terms, Germany was forced
              to cede substantial territories, including Alsace-Lorraine [1]
              [4] (to France). [1] West Prussia was given to Poland, and the
              Polish "corridor to the sea" was created. [4] Eupen-Malmedy
              and Neutral Moresnet are ceded to Belgium. Danzig and the

              a coal-rich territory, was put under French control for 15
              years, and the Rhineland was to be occupied by the Allies
              for 15 years, and then permanently demilitarized. Germany was
              to maintain an army no larger than 100,000 men, with no air
              force, and a navy of 6 ships. Germany was also forced to pay
              reparations of 20 billion marks. Lastly, the League of Nations
              was created. The peace of Versailles bore little resemblance
              to Wilson's "Fourteen Points." Wilson was committed to a
              relatively mild agreement, but Britain and, even more so,
              France under Clemenceau demanded the harsh terms that were
              imposed on Germany. [4]
