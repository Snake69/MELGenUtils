 8 Sep 1565 On the coast in Florida, the Spanish founded San Agustin
              (St. Augustine). [1] [2] [3] St. Augustine is the oldest
              continuously-inhabited European settlement in any State of the
              United States. [1] [33] This is the second oldest settlement,
              following only San Juan, Puerto Rico, in the current territory
              and possessions of the United States. The Spanish leader,
              Admiral Pedro Menendez de Aviles, becomes Florida's first

       1585 Under the supervision of Sir Walter Raleigh a colonizing
              expedition composed solely of men, many of them veteran soldiers
              who had fought to establish the British rule in Ireland, was sent
              to establish a colony in Virginia. With about 75 men, Raleigh
              decided to establish the English colony at the northern end of
              Roanoke Island. The British ships disembarked on 17 Aug 1585,
              leaving the isolated men to form a colony. [1]
22 Jul 1587 Roanoke Colony: A second group of English settlers arrives on
              Roanoke Island off North Carolina to re-establish the deserted
              colony. [1] [3]
       1590 The initial colony was abandoned but a second attempt led by
              John White, an artist and friend of Sir Walter Raleigh who
              had accompanied the previous expeditions to Roanoke, was sent
              out. After problems with the colony mounted they sent White
              back to England for help due to the continuing war with Spain
              (Anglo-Spanish War (1585)), White was not able to mount
              another resupply attempt for three more years. He finally
              gained passage on a privateering expedition that agreed to
              stop off at Roanoke on the way back from the Caribbean. White
              landed on 18 Aug 1590, on his granddaughter's third birthday,
              but found the settlement deserted. His men could not find any
              trace of the ninety men, seventeen women, and eleven children,
              nor was there any sign of a struggle or battle. The only clue
              was the word "Croatoan" carved into a post of the fort and
              "Cro" carved into a nearby tree. [1]
       1598 Espanola (in present-day New Mexico) founded by Juan de Onate. [1]
            San Juan de los Caballeros (in present-day New Mexico)
              founded. [1]
15 May 1602 Cape Cod discovered by English navigator Bartholomew Gosnold. [3]
       1604 Saint Croix Island (in present-day Maine) founded. [1]
13 May 1607 The London Company made a successful settlement, the first
              permanent English settlement in America, at Jamestown, Virginia
              Colony. Jamestown was named after the English King, James I. [1]
              [6] The settlement had from the start great difficulties:
              1. The immigrants were adventurers, broken gentlemen, and
              criminals; 2. The situation of the settlement was undesirable
              on account of malarial conditions; 3. The colonists gave their
              attention to seeking gold, finding a passageway through the
              continent, and hunting adventure; 4. The industrial system,
              according to which all labored for a common store, did not
              encourage thrift; 5. The government was cumbersome. There was
              to be a home-council in England and another in the colony,
              both of which were appointed by the King; 6. The incompetence
              of the King's appointees. The ability of John Smith helped the
              colony through some of its early difficulties. He compelled the
              colonists to work and secured the friendship of the Indians. [6]
   Aug 1607 British Plymouth Company colonists established their settlement,
              known as the Popham Colony, in the present-day town of
              Phippsburg, Maine near the mouth of the Kennebec River. [1]
              The leader was Sir Ferdinando Gorges. The colony failed. [6]
       1608 The Popham Colony colonists abandoned their colony leaving
              on the 30-ton ship, a pinnace they named Virginia. It was
              the first ship built in America by Europeans, and was meant
              to show that the colony could be used for shipbuilding. The
              short-lived colony had lasted about a year. [1]

22 Dec 1620 The Pilgrim Fathers formed the first settlement in New England
              at Plymouth. [6] Plymouth Colony organized. [1] The "Council
              for New England" succeeded to the possessions of the Plymouth
              Company in North America from 40 degrees to 48 degrees of
              latitude. The first republican form of government in America was
              established at Plymouth.  The Pilgrims, before landing, signed
              an agreement called "The Mayflower Compact." By this compact
              they established themselves into a body politic, agreeing to be
              governed by the will of the majority. This is evidence that the
              Pilgrims did not intend to be temporary residents in the new
              world. [6] Aided by Squanto, a Native American of the Patuxet
              people, the colony was able to establish a treaty with Chief
              Massasoit which helped to ensure the colony's success. The
              colony played a central role in King Philip's War, one of the
              earliest and bloodiest of the Indian Wars. Ultimately, the
              colony was annexed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1691. [1]

              claimed that the colonists had no right to their lands except
              through Indian purchase. The opposition of the Puritan ministers,
              who controlled the government, caused him to be driven from

              the colony of New Sweden, led by Governor Johan Risingh. The
              fort was taken without a fight because its garrison did not
              have any gunpowder, and the fort was renamed Fort Trinity
              (in Swedish, Trefaldigheten). As reprisal, the Dutch - led by
              Governor Peter Stuyvesant - moved an army to the Delaware River
              in the late summer of 1655, leading to the immediate surrender
              of Fort Trinity and Fort Christina. Thus the settlement was

              New Jerseyans, who had disputed Carteret's proprietorship,
              granted by the Duke of York, from the beginning, claimed the
              sale was illegal, since they had been granted land by New
              York Deputy Governor Richard Nicolls and also paid the local
              Lenape for it. The dispute led to generations of political

10 Feb 1763 The Treaty of Paris ended the French and Indian War in
              North America and the Seven Years War in Europe, Asia and
              Africa. France relinquished to England all her possessions on
              the mainland of North America east of the Mississippi River
              except New Orleans; Spain ceded Florida to England (but later
              received New Orleans and French Louisiana from them); and France

              Colonies. [1]
       1769 Ninety Six, South Carolina founded. [1]
16 Jul 1769 Spain established the first permanent settlement in California.
              The settlement was called "Mission San Diego de Alcala." The
              mission helped strengthen the Spanish claim to the area. Its
              inhabitants migrated from Mexico, beginning a long California
              tradition. [18] Father Junipero Serra founds the mission, 1st
              mission in California. [1] [8] Over the following decades,
              it evolves into the city of San Diego, California. [1]

            The Province of New Jersey, becomes the State of New Jersey. [1]
            The Province of New York, becomes the State of New York. [1]
            The Province of North Carolina, becomes the State of North
              Carolina; some believe the colony declared independence on 20
              May 1775, but this is disputed. [1]
            The Province of Pennsylvania, becomes the State of Pennsylvania.
              [1]
            The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, commonly
              known as Rhode Island, which was the Colony of Rhode Island
              and Providence Plantations before declaring independence on
              4 May 1776. [1]
            The Province of South Carolina, becomes the State of South
              Carolina. [1]
            The Colony of Virginia, becomes the Commonwealth of Virginia. [1]
            The entirety of the new United States was claimed by Great
              Britain. Of particular note are Machias Seal Island and North
              Rock, two small islands off the northeast coast which remain
              disputed up to the present. [1]
 9 Sep 1776 The United States of America officially gets its name. [33]

              enacted a constitution, renaming itself the Delaware State. [1]
28 Sep 1776 The State of Pennsylvania enacted a constitution, renaming
              itself the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [1]
15 Jan 1777 The northeastern region of New York, known as the New Hampshire
              Grants, declared independence as New Connecticut. [1]
18 Jan 1777 San Jose, California, founded; [1] [3] originally known as El
              Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe, the first town in the Spanish
              colony of Nueva California (which became Alta California). [1]
 4 Jun 1777 New Connecticut was renamed Vermont. [1]
29 Nov 1777 San Jose, California, is founded as Pueblo de San Jose de
              Guadalupe by Jose Joaquin Moraga. It is the first civilian
              settlement, or pueblo, in Alta California. [1]
       1778 Louisville, Kentucky founded, expanded from Fort Nelson,
              established by George Rogers Clark. [1]
            West Point, New York founded, expanded from Fort Clinton. [1]
11 Jun 1778 Vermont claimed what was called the "East Union," consisting
              of some towns in New Hampshire that petitioned on 12 Mar 1778
              to join with Vermont due to a concern that their state was
              focusing too much on its coastal region. Vermont never gained
              full control over the area. [1]
21 Oct 1778 Due to pressure from the Continental Congress, Vermont rescinded
              the annexation of the East Union; the legislature declared on
              12 Feb 1779 that the East Union should be considered null from
              its beginning. [1]
       1779 Jonesborough Tennessee founded; first capital of the State of
              Franklin, in 1784. [1]
            Nashville, Tennessee founded, expanded from Fort Nashborough. [1]
31 Aug 1779 Virginia surrendered its claim to southwest Pennsylvania when
              the two states agreed to extend the Mason-Dixon line westward
              to five degrees west of the Delaware River, with the border
              turning north from there. [1]
   Mar 1780 North Carolina and Virginia surveyed their border further
              inland. Virginia's survey reached to the Tennessee River,
              but North Carolina's only went as far as the Cumberland Gap,
              and as the two surveys were roughly two miles apart, this
              created a thin area claimed by both states. Since the dispute
              only technically went as far west as the Cumberland Gap, beyond
              that point North Carolina's line is faded to show that it was
              more an assumption, and beyond the Tennessee River both lines
              are faded. While the border was intended to follow 36 degrees
              30' north, early surveying errors caused it to veer north
              of that, reaching a distance of seventeen miles off by the
              time it reached the Tennessee River. [1]
25 Oct 1780 The State of Massachusetts Bay enacted a constitution, renaming
              itself the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. [1]
       1781 Montpelier, Vermont founded [1]
18 Mar 1781 Washington County, Pennsylvania formed from Westmoreland County,
              Pennsylvania [4]
 4 Apr 1781 Vermont again claimed an East Union, consisting of some towns
              in New Hampshire that wished to join with Vermont; more towns
              were interested than during the first attempt in 1778, though
              again, the exact extent of the borders is unknown. Vermont
              never gained full control over the area. [1]
16 Jun 1781 Vermont claimed what was called the "West Union," consisting
              of some towns in New York, mainly to counterbalance Vermont's
              attempt at eastward expansion. Vermont never gained full control
              over the area. The specific date this occurred is unclear;
              sources suggest 16 Jun, 26 Jun and 18 Jul. [1]
 4 Sep 1781 Los Angeles is founded as El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora La Reina
              de los Angeles (The Village of Our Lady, the Queen of the
              Angels) by 44 Spanish settlers [1] in the Bahia de las Fumas
              (Bay of Smokes) [3] under the leadership of Governor Felipe
              de Neve. [2] [19]
       1782 Sussex County, NJ - Independence Township is set off from
              Hardwick. [5]
22 Feb 1782 Vermont abandoned its attempts to annex the East Union from
              New Hampshire and the West Union from New York. [1]
29 Oct 1782 The federal government accepted the cession from New York of its
              western claims, which the state ceded on 17 Feb 1780. New York
              proclaimed its new western border to be a line drawn south from
              the western end of Lake Ontario; at its maximum interpretation,
              the state claimed an area bordered by Lake Erie, Lake Huron
              and Lake Michigan; to the Illinois, Mississippi, and Tennessee
              Rivers; and north along the Appalachian Mountains, ending at the
              border with Pennsylvania. It is unclear from where this claim
              came; many sources state that New York had surrendered it, but
              very few elaborate on how it was obtained. One source states
              that it was a cession by the Six Nations, who had conquered
              much of the region. However, New York never seriously enforced
              these claims. The cession included the small tip of New York
              north of Pennsylvania, the Erie Triangle. [1]
30 Dec 1782 The Congress of the Confederation declared that the land
              that Connecticut claimed in northern Pennsylvania was part
              of Pennsylvania, thus attempting to end the Pennamite-Yankee
              War. The claim was an extension of Connecticut's northernmost
              and southernmost borders westward, skipping New Jersey and New
              York, though as Connecticut's northern border was a few miles
              north of Pennsylvania's northern border, a small sliver of New
              York was also claimed. While conflict would continue for some
              time, this was the end of the formal claim by Connecticut. [1]
       1783 Clarksville, Indiana founded [1]
20 Jan 1783 Great Britain surrendered East Florida and West Florida to
              Spain; British inhabitants had 18 months from the date of
              ratification to leave. [1]
 3 Sep 1783 The Treaty of Paris formally ended the American Revolutionary
              War between Great Britain and the United States of America,
              which had rebelled against British rule. The other combatant
              nations, France, Spain and the Dutch Republic, had separate
              agreements, known as the Peace of Paris (1783). The Kingdom
              of Great Britain recognized the territory south of what is
              now Canada, east of the Mississippi and north of Florida as
              American property. Vermont remained independent until 1791. [1]
26 Sep 1783 Fayette County, Pennsylvania formed from Westmoreland County,
              Pennsylvania. [4]
17 Oct 1783 Longmeadow, Massachusetts incorporated [1]
20 Dec 1783 Virginia cedes western land to federal government. [10]
       1784 Frenchtown, Michigan founded [1]
            Whitestown, near Utica, New York, first settled by Hugh White
              from Connecticut. [7]
            Grigory Ivanovich Shelikhov, who later set up the Russian-Alaska
              Company that colonized early Alaska, arrived in Three Saints
              Bay on Kodiak Island with two ships, the Three Saints and the
              St. Simon. The indigenous Koniag harassed the Russian party and
              Shelikhov responded by killing hundreds and taking hostages
              to enforce the obedience of the rest. Having established
              his authority on Kodiak Island, Shelikhov founded the second
              permanent Russian settlement in Alaska (after Unalaska) on
              the island's Three Saints Bay. [1]
 1 Mar 1784 Virginia ceded its claims northwest of the Ohio River to the
              federal government. Connecticut continued to claim its western
              lands that had overlapped Virginia's cession. [1]
12 May 1784 Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States,
              ending its claim to the country. The treaty ended the American
              Revolutionary War, though military action had largely ended
              after the Franco-American victory at Yorktown on 19 Oct 1781.
              Because of ambiguities and poor knowledge of geography,
              the treaty was unclear in several areas: The northeastern
              border was defined as running from the headlands of the
              St. Croix River, but there were several options for that.
              (2) The northwestern border was defined as a line running
              west from the northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods
              to the Mississippi River, but the river's source was south
              of that; maps universally show the line as running directly
              from the Lake of the Woods to the river's source, Lake Itasca.
              The border extending from Lake Superior towards the Lake of
              the Woods was poorly defined as starting from "Long Lake,"
              which both sides interpreted to their advantage. Machias Seal
              Island and North Rock, off Maine, remained disputed, as did
              Sugar Island off the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. [1]
            The Peace of Paris also involved treaties with France and Spain,
              with Great Britain ceding the Floridas to Spain. During their
              ownership of West Florida, the British had moved its border
              north, and the cession to Spain appeared to apply to the full
              extent of the British colony. However, the British-American
              treaty granted the extension of West Florida to the United
              States, where it enlarged Georgia south to 31 degrees north,
              indicating that only the original definition of West Florida
              was to be ceded to Spain. The local Spanish governors also
              made a move to occupy forts along the Mississippi River,
              with claims to everything south of the Tennessee River; it
              is unknown how official or strong these claims were, and they
              are not mapped as they are in conflict with the other Spanish
              claim involving the border of West Florida. [1]
14 Aug 1784 The first Russian settlement is established in Alaska on Kodiak
              Island. [9]
23 Aug 1784 Delegates from the North Carolina counties of Washington,
              Sullivan, Spencer (now Hawkins) and Greene - all in
              present-day Tennessee - convened in the town of Jonesborough
              and declared the lands the State of Frankland, independent
              of North Carolina. A constitution modeled on that of North
              Carolina was adopted with few changes, and the state name
              was changed to "Franklin". The government of Franklin held
              some control over the area, and petitioned for statehood,
              receiving support from seven of the nine states required, but
              would only last a few years. By 1790, the state government
              had collapsed entirely and the territory was again firmly
              under the control of North Carolina. [1]
 9 Sep 1784 Franklin County, Pennsylvania formed from Cumberland County,
              Pennsylvania [4]
10 Sep 1784 Montgomery County, Pennsylvania formed from Philadelphia County,
              Pennsylvania [4]
22 Oct 1784 Russia founds a colony on Kodiak Island, Alaska. [1]
       1785 Hudson incorporated a city [7]
            Harrisburg, Pennsylvania founded [1]
            Asheville, North Carolina founded [1]
            Dubuque, Iowa founded [1]
21 Jan 1785 Chippewa, Delaware, Ottawa and Wyandot Indians signed a treaty of
              Fort McIntosh, ceding present-day Ohio to the United States. [16]
 4 Mar 1785 Dauphin County, Pennsylvania formed from Lancaster County,
              Pennsylvania [4]
19 Apr 1785 The federal government accepted the cession from Massachusetts
              of its extreme western claim, which consisted of a strip of
              land west of Lake Huron and the Detroit River, bounded on
              the north by a line extending west from roughly halfway north
              through New Hampshire, which was the maximal interpretation
              of Massachusetts Bay's colonial borders, and on the south by
              a line extending from the state's southwest corner. The claim
              was never seriously enforced. [1]
   Jun 1785 The State of Frankland was renamed the State of Franklin,
              to encourage Benjamin Franklin to endorse the state, though
              he declined. [1]
       1786 the Genesee country granted to Massachusetts [7]
            Columbia, South Carolina founded [1]
            Florissant, Missouri founded (originally known as St. Ferdinand)
            Frankfort, Kentucky founded [1]
            Lynchburg, Virginia founded [1]
            Portland, Maine founded [1]
            Steubenville, Ohio founded [1]
13 Sep 1786 Connecticut surrendered its western claim to the federal
              government except for its Western Reserve, though it is
              unclear how much control they held over the ceded region;
              like the claim to Pennsylvania, this was a western extension
              of Connecticut's northernmost and southernmost points. [1]
25 Sep 1786 Luzerne County, Pennsylvania formed from Northumberland County,
              Pennsylvania [4]
16 Dec 1786 Massachusetts surrendered its claim to western New York, though
              it is unclear if Massachusetts ever held control over the region,
              as the claim was to the "soil, not the sovereignty". This land,
              which was the area west of a north-south line 82 miles west of
              where the Delaware River entered New York, was later known as the
              Phelps and Gorham Purchase. It is likely that Massachusetts also
              claimed the Erie Triangle, but since this treaty was directly
              with New York, and New York had already ceded it to the federal
              government, it is not marked as being ceded by Massachusetts. [1]
       1787 Spartanburg, South Carolina founded [1]
13 Jul 1787 The Territory Northwest of the Ohio River, ceded earlier by
              Virginia, [1] was organized and commonly became known as the
              Northwest Territory. [1] [33]
 9 Aug 1787 South Carolina ceded its western claim to the federal government,
              though it was a result of inaccurate geography and South
              Carolina never actually held claim to this land. The claim was
              of a strip of land between the border of North Carolina and
              the source of the Savannah River but, unknown at the time,
              the river originated in North Carolina. The eastern part of
              this cession would be given to Georgia in 1802, despite Georgia
              technically already having claim to the land. [1]
20 Sep 1787 Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania formed from Bedford County,
              Pennsylvania [4]

              and admitted to Union [9]
12 Dec 1787 Pennsylvania becomes the 2nd state to ratify the Constitution
              [1] [8] and admitted to Union, [9] five days after Delaware
              became the first. [1]
18 Dec 1787 New Jersey was the third state to ratify the United States
              Constitution [1] [17] and admitted to Union. [9]
       1788 Cooperstown village, New York laid out. [7]
            Marietta, Ohio founded. [1]

              [1] [8] and admitted to Union. [9]
21 Jun 1788 The Constitution was established. [6] [33] Nine states were
              necessary to the establishment of a Constitution and [6]
              New Hampshire made the ninth state [1] [6] (in a 57 to
              46 vote). There had been a great deal of opposition to
              ratification, the chief objections being that the rights of
              the people were not enumerated and that the central government
              was too strong. Much of this opposition was explained away by
              the Federalist, a remarkable serial paper written by Madison,
              Hamilton, and Jay, explaining and defending the proposed
              Constitution. [6]

              Washington Counties, Pennsylvania. [4]
   Feb 1789 John Sevier, governor of the State of Franklin, pledged
              allegiance to North Carolina, effectively ending the claimed
              independence of Franklin. [1]
 7 Aug 1789 The Northwest Territory was reorganized under the

              the Territory South of the River Ohio, commonly known as the
              Southwest Territory. [1]
29 May 1790 Rhode Island admitted to Union [9]
16 Jul 1790 The District of Columbia is established [1] [8] [33] as the
              capital of the United States [1] [33] after signature of
              the Residence Act [1] at a site along the Potomac River;
              the area would become Washington, D.C. [2]
25 Nov 1790 Trenton [Township], New Jersey became state capital. [12]
       1791 Georgetown, Delaware founded [1]

            Bangor, Maine founded [1]
 4 Mar 1791 The Vermont Republic, which included land claimed by New York and
              New Hampshire and, while unrecognized by the United States,
              was a de facto independent country, was admitted to the US
              as the 14th state, Vermont. Windsor yields to Philadelphia
              as the federal capital. [1]
30 Mar 1791 The District of Columbia, a federal district planned to house
              the federal government by 1800, was formed from land ceded
              by Maryland and Virginia, consisting of a 100 square mile
              diamond, with its southern tip at Jones Point, straddling
              the Potomac River. However, it was not yet given that name,
              being simply referred to as the federal district. In Sep 1791,
              the commissioners in charge of planning the city would term
              it the "Territory of Columbia", and various laws refer to a
              District of Columbia, but sometimes informally. The area does
              not appear to have been formally named "District of Columbia"
              until at least the organic act of 1871. The name "Columbia"
              was used from very early on, and at least informally by the
              government. [1]
       1792 Bath, New York first settled by Capt. E. Williamson. [7]

              Pennsylvania [4]
29 Feb 1796 Great Britain agreed to abandon several forts in the northwest
              that it still occupied, including Detroit. The treaty also
              provided for commissions to determine the border between the
              northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods and the source
              of the Mississippi River, and which river to consider the
              St. Croix River. [1]
25 Apr 1796 The northern half of West Florida was ceded by Spain, resolving
              the dispute over the region. [1]

 7 Apr 1798 Due to the Yazoo Land Fraud, an act authorized President John
              Adams to appoint commissioners to negotiate with Georgia about
              ceding its western land. The act created Mississippi Territory
              from the southwestern quarter of Georgia in the region recently
              ceded by West Florida, while maintaining that Georgia still held
              rights over the territory. [1] Natchez becomes the capital of
              the Mississippi Territory. [2] The Mississippi Territory is
              expanded in 1804 and again in 1812. [1]
25 Oct 1798 Commissioners agreed on the source of the St. Croix River,
              setting the lower portion of the border between Massachusetts
              and Great Britain and, thus, where the eastern north-south
              line originated. [1]
       1799 Sitka was originally settled by the native Tlingit people. Old
              Sitka was founded this year by Alexandr Baranov, the governor
              of Russian America. Baranov arrived under the auspices of the
              Russian-American Company, a "semi-official" colonial trading
              company chartered by Tsar Paul I. [1]

 7 May 1800 Indiana Territory organized [3]
 9 Jun 1800 Connecticut ceded its Western Reserve to the federal government,
              which assigned it to the Northwest Territory. The act doing
              so was passed in Congress on 28 Apr 1800, and Connecticut
              approved it on this date. [1]
 4 Jul 1800 Indiana Territory was formed from the western portion of
              Northwest Territory. It corresponded to present-day Illinois,
              Indiana, northeastern Minnesota, and Wisconsin, as well as the
              western half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and all but
              the eastern tip of the Upper Peninsula. Northwest Territory
              was left with only most of Ohio and the rest of Michigan. [1]
 1 Oct 1800 In the secretly negotiated Third Treaty of San Ildefonso
              (formally titled the Preliminary and Secret Treaty between the
              French Republic and His Catholic Majesty the King of Spain,
              Concerning the Aggrandizement of His Royal Highness the Infant
              Duke of Parma in Italy and the Retrocession of Louisiana),
              Spain returned the colonial territory of Louisiana to France. [1]
17 Nov 1800 The Congress of the United States moved from Philadelphia to
              Washington in the District of Columbia, now built and ready
              to be the capital. This was two weeks before the 1 Dec date
              established in the Residence Act; President John Adams urged
              Congress to move early in hopes of securing enough Southern
              votes to be re-elected, though this failed. [1]
12 Dec 1800 Washington, DC established as capital of US [3]
       1801 Buffalo, New York laid out by the Holland Land Company [7]
            Athens, Georgia founded [1]
27 Feb 1801 The District of Columbia was organized. [1]
       1802 Sackett's Harbor, New York first settled by A. Sackett, Esq [7]
26 Apr 1802 Georgia ceded its western half, known as the Yazoo Lands, to the
              federal government. At the same time, the federal government
              ceded to Georgia the eastern portion of the land previously
              ceded by South Carolina, though in reality Georgia technically
              already held title to the land, as the description of the earlier
              cession was based on an erroneous understanding of geography. [1]
 3 May 1802 Washington, DC is incorporated as a city [3]
       1803 Ashtabula, Ohio founded [1]
            Chicago, Illinois founded, expanded from Fort Dearborn. [1]
 1 Mar 1803 The southern half of the Northwest Territory, along with a thin
              sliver of Indiana Territory, was [1] admitted as the seventeenth
              state, Ohio. [1] [8] The remainder of the Northwest Territory was
              transferred to Indiana Territory. The western border was a
              line due north from the mouth of the Great Miami River to a
              point east from the southern tip of Lake Michigan. The federal
              description then said it should go east from there, whereas
              the Ohio Constitution stated it should intersect with the most
              northerly cape of Maumee Bay, essentially the western tip of
              Lake Erie. The confusion caused by these varying descriptions
              of the state's borders, combined with inaccurate knowledge of
              geography, as no one at the time knew just how far south Lake
              Michigan extended, would lead to the conflict over the Toledo
              Strip. [1]
30 Mar 1803 Indiana County, Pennsylvania formed from Westmoreland and
              Lycoming Counties, Pennsylvania [4]
30 Apr 1803 The Louisiana Purchase was made, expanding the United States
              west of the Mississippi River. There was a dispute with West
              Florida over how much land east of the Mississippi River
              it included. The purchase extended slightly north of the
              modern borders, as it was defined only as the watershed
              of the Mississippi River. The purchase consisted of the
              whole of present-day Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri,
              Nebraska and Oklahoma, and portions of Colorado, Louisiana,
              Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota,
              Texas and Wyoming. It also included the southernmost
              portions of the present-day Canadian provinces of Alberta,
              Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. The cost was 60 million francs
              ($11,250,000) plus cancellation of debts worth 18 million
              francs ($3,750,000). Including interest, the U.S. finally
              paid $23,213,568 (US$379,980,315 in 2018) for the Louisiana
              territory. Acquiring the Louisiana Territory doubled the size
              of the United States. [1] Jefferson, who was unsure of the
              constitutionality of the move, rushed to complete the sale
              anyway, lest Napoleon change his mind. [18] This begins the
              U.S.' westward expansion to the Pacific referred to as its
              Manifest Destiny which involves annexing and conquering land
              from Mexico, Britain and Native Americans. [1]
 3 Nov 1803 The border between Tennessee and Virginia was resurveyed
              and established, ending the dispute over that part of the
              border. The border between Kentucky and Tennessee, despite
              following the original survey, remained vaguely defined. [1]
20 Dec 1803 The United States purchased Louisiana from France. The area is
              c1,000,000 sq. miles for c$20/sq.mi; the purchase more than
              doubles the area of the country. [8] This is the date of the
              formal turnover in New Orleans; the purchase was completed on
              30 Apr 1803. The transfer would be recognized in St. Louis in
              Upper Louisiana on 10 Mar 1804, known as Three Flags Day. [1]
            The extent of what constituted Louisiana was disputed with Spain:
              the United States claimed the purchase included the part of West
              Florida west of the Perdido River, and the southwestern border
              with New Spain was disputed, as the United States claimed the
              Sabine River as the border, but Spain maintained it was the
              Calcasieu River and others. [1]
       1804 The "Southwick Jog" was transferred from Connecticut to
              Massachusetts, to put to rest long-standing disagreements over
              the border between the two states. [1]
            Stow, Ohio founded [1]
            Milledgeville, Georgia founded [1]

              Pennsylvania [4]
27 Mar 1804 The land between Tennessee and Mississippi Territory previously
              ceded by Georgia was assigned to Mississippi Territory. [1]
 1 Oct 1804 Orleans Territory was organized from the Louisiana Purchase
              south of 33 degrees north, with the remainder being designated
              the District of Louisiana and placed under the jurisdiction
              of Indiana Territory. [1]
       1805 Huntsville, Alabama founded [1]
11 Jan 1805 Michigan Territory was split from Indiana Territory, including
              the whole of the lower peninsula of present-day Michigan but
              only that eastern tip of the upper peninsula which was held
              by the Northwest Territory after Indiana Territory had been
              split from it. [1]
30 Jun 1805 Michigan Territory was organized from Indiana Territory, defined
              as north of a line east from the southern tip of Lake Michigan,
              and east of a line north from the lake's northern tip. The
              southeastern portion of the border technically conflicted with
              the definition of Ohio, which claimed the Toledo Strip north
              of that line; however, the exact position of Lake Michigan
              was not yet known. [1]
 4 Jul 1805 The District of Louisiana was organized as Louisiana
              Territory. [1]
10 Nov 1808 Osage Treaty signed; [3] Osage Indians cede Missouri and
              Arkansas lands. [10]
 3 Feb 1809 Territory of Illinois organizes [1] [3] (including present-day
              Wisconsin), [3] created by the 10th United States Congress. [1]
 1 Mar 1809 Illinois Territory was split from Indiana Territory. Illinois
              Territory included present-day Illinois, northeastern Minnesota,
              and Wisconsin. Indiana Territory included the present-day
              borders of Indiana, with its western and eastern borders
              continuing northward; thus, it also included the central
              portion of the upper peninsula of Michigan, as well as Door
              Peninsula of present-day Wisconsin. [1]
27 Mar 1809 Sullivan County, New York formed from Ulster County, New
              York. [15]
       1810 Manchester, New Hampshire founded [1]
            San Bernardino, California founded [1]

              Counties, Pennsylvania. [4]
            Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania formed from Luzerne County,
              Pennsylvania. [4]
24 Mar 1810 Ontario County, Pennsylvania became Bradford County, Pennsylvania.
              [4]
26 Sep 1810 The Republic of West Florida declared independence from
              Spain. It maintained some control over its territory. [1]
27 Oct 1810 US President James Madison proclaimed the annexation of the Baton
              Rouge and Mobile Districts of West Florida, declaring them part
              of the Louisiana Purchase. The US Army occupied the capital,
              St. Francisville, on 6 Dec and Baton Rouge on 10 Dec, bringing
              an end to the Republic of West Florida after 90 days. [1]
10 Dec 1810 Armed forces led by William C. C. Claiborne took possession
              of the portion of West Florida west of the Pearl River,
              following a proclamation on 27 Oct 1810 by President James
              Madison to do so. The United States had considered the region
              part of the Louisiana Purchase, including the area which had
              revolted against Spanish Florida and formed the Republic of
              West Florida. Madison's proclamation stated that it was to be
              "taken as part" of Orleans Territory. The land west of Mobile
              Bay to the Pearl River was occupied and annexed de facto by
              the military in 1811. [1]
       1811 Astoria, Oregon founded, expanded from Fort Astoria, founded
              by the Pacific Fur Company. [1]

            Columbus, Ohio founded [1]
 6 Mar 1812 Lehigh County, Pennsylvania formed from Northampton County,
              Pennsylvania. [4]
30 Apr 1812 Most of Orleans Territory was admitted as the eighteenth
              state, Louisiana. The southeastern remainder presumably became
              unorganized territory, as it had no definition for a while. [1]
14 May 1812 The claimed portion of West Florida east of the Pearl River
              was assigned to Mississippi Territory, though the area around
              Mobile Bay remained under the control of Spanish Florida. The
              United States militarily occupied Mobile and the surrounding
              area up to the Perdido River in Apr 1813. [1]
 4 Jun 1812 Since its name was now shared with the state of Louisiana,
              [1] Louisiana Territory was renamed Missouri Territory. [1] [8]
 4 Aug 1812 The remaining claimed portion of West Florida was added to
              Louisiana, following the assent of that state to an act passed
              by Congress on 14 Apr 1812. [1]
16 Aug 1812 During the War of 1812, the garrison at Fort Detroit surrendered,
              leading the United Kingdom to occupy Detroit, the capital and
              population center of Michigan Territory. [1]
14 Sep 1812 Gallatin County, Illinois formed. [11]

              Pennsylvania. [4]
29 Sep 1813 Fort Detroit was recaptured by American forces following
              the Battle of Lake Erie, regaining control over Michigan
              Territory. [1]

              Lawrence Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
11 Dec 1816 The southern part of Indiana Territory, along with small parts
              of Illinois Territory and Michigan Territory, were admitted
              as the nineteenth state, Indiana. The remainder of Indiana
              Territory across Lake Michigan became unorganized territory. [1]
31 Dec 1816 Crawford County, Illinois formed. [11]
       1817 Fort Smith, Arkansas founded [1]
            Milan, Ohio founded [1]

 3 Mar 1817 Alabama Territory was split from Mississippi Territory; both
              correspond to their present-day counterparts. [1] [3]
10 Nov 1817 The Tennessee legislature enacted laws that defined the common
              boundary with Georgia and created a boundary commission to
              jointly survey and mark the state border. [16]
10 Dec 1817 Mississippi Territory was admitted to the US as the 20th state,
              Mississippi. [1]

            Union County, Illinois formed. [11]
            Washington County, Illinois formed. [11]
 6 Feb 1818 Alabama Territory created Tuskaloosa County with a description
              that inadvertently overlapped with Mississippi. It described
              the border of the county as running "a due west course to,
              the Tombeckbe river; thence up the same to the Cotton Gin
              Port". Unknown at the time, the origin of the Tombigbee River
              and Cotton Gin Port were in Mississippi. [1]
16 Apr 1818 The United States Senate ratifies the Rush-Bagot Treaty,
              establishing the border with Canada. [1]
30 Jun 1818 Per the terms of the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812,
              the United Kingdom returned Moose Island to Massachusetts,
              and the United States returned Campobello Island, Deer Island,
              and Grand Manan Island to the United Kingdom, all of which
              were captured from the other side during the war. [1]
20 Oct 1818 The Treaty of 1818 established the 49th parallel [1] [16] north west of
              the Lake of the Woods as the border with British-held lands,
              and Oregon Country was established as a shared land between
              the United States and United Kingdom. Oregon Country consisted
              of most of present-day Idaho and Oregon, all of Washington,
              and a portion of Montana, as well as the southern part of the
              unorganized British territory which became British Columbia. The
              treaty transferred the Red River Basin to the United States,
              consisting of northwestern Minnesota, northeastern North Dakota,
              and the northeastern tip of South Dakota. [1]
 3 Dec 1818 The southern portion of Illinois Territory was admitted as
              the 21st state, Illinois. The remainder was reassigned to
              Michigan Territory. The unorganized lands which had been a
              part of Indiana Territory prior to the admission of Indiana
              as a state were also assigned to Michigan Territory. [1]
       1819 Memphis, Tennessee founded, expanded from the 1739 French Fort
              de l'Assomption which was not resettled for 79 years. [1]
            Chapel Hill, North Carolina founded [1]
            Montgomery, Alabama founded, expanded from the 1540 French
              settlement, Fort Toulouse. [1]
            Springfield, Illinois founded [1]
            Tuscaloosa, Alabama founded [1]
30 Jan 1819 The Treaty of 1818 went into effect, setting 49 degrees north
              as the border with the United Kingdom west of the Lake of the
              Woods, and also establishing the Oregon Country as a shared
              region with the United Kingdom. Oregon Country had no defined
              northern limit, but it can be assumed that it did not encroach
              much upon Russian-held lands; a later-established line was at
              54 degrees 40' north. [1]
22 Feb 1819 The Adams-Onis Treaty or Transcontinental Treaty was signed
              in Washington, establishing a defined border between the
              United States and New Spain. The treaty ceded Spain's claims
              to Oregon Country to the United States and American claims
              to Texas to Spain; moved portions of present-day Colorado,
              Oklahoma, and Wyoming, and all of New Mexico and Texas, to New
              Spain; and all of Spanish Florida as well as a small portion
              of modern day Colorado to the United States. The new borders
              intruded on Arkansaw Territory's Miller County, created on
              1 Apr 1820, which dipped below the Red River and into land
              ceded to Spain. However, the remoteness of the region caused
              no serious conflict with Spain. [1]
 2 Mar 1819 The southern part of Missouri Territory was organized as Arkansaw
              Territory, consisting of present-day Arkansas as well as part of
              Oklahoma. It was not officially spelled Arkansas until later. [1]
 4 Mar 1819 Alexander County, Illinois formed. [11]
22 Mar 1819 Clark County, Illinois formed. [11]
26 Mar 1819 Jefferson County, Illinois formed. [11]
            Wayne County, Illinois formed. [11]
 4 Jul 1819 Arkansaw Territory was organized from the southern slice of
              Missouri Territory. [1]
14 Dec 1819 Alabama Territory was admitted to the US as the 22nd state,
              Alabama. The statehood act provided for a survey of the southern
              part of the border with Mississippi for correction if it was
              discovered to encroach upon Mississippi's defined borders;
              it was later discovered to do so. [1]
       1820 The Kingdom of Hawai'i establishes its capital at Lahaina. [1]
            South Bend, Indiana founded, formerly named Big St. Joseph
              Station. [1]
            Oliver's Grove, Minnesota founded near the confluence of the
              Mississippi, St. Croix, and Vermillion Rivers; established as
              a trading post and a military detachment from Fort Snelling. [1]
15 Mar 1820 As part of the Missouri Compromise, the District of Maine,
              the northern and separate part of Massachusetts, was admitted
              as the twenty-third state, Maine. [1]
16 Mar 1820 The Maine District of Massachusetts was split off and admitted
              to the US as the 23rd state, Maine, as part of the Missouri
              Compromise. [1]
22 Mar 1820 Perry County, Pennsylvania formed from Cumberland County,
              Pennsylvania [4]
21 Apr 1820 This is the earliest known date of the name "Arkansas Territory"
              being officially used instead of "Arkansaw Territory". [1]
12 May 1820 The border between Kentucky and Tennessee was established. To
              make up for the fact that the border between the Cumberland Gap
              and the Tennessee River veered north as much as 17 miles from
              36 degrees 30' north, a new survey was conducted starting at
              that latitude on the Mississippi River and moving east to the
              Tennessee River, hence guaranteeing this last bit of border
              would fit the original ideal. [1]
19 Jul 1820 The overlap of the longitudinal southern border between Alabama
              and Mississippi was resolved, as per the act admitting Alabama
              as a state, because the provisional border encroached on
              Mississippi. As the result of a survey, the southern border
              terminus was moved about 3.8 miles to the east, which changed
              the border up to the then-northwest corner of Alabama's
              Washington County. The date when this happened is unclear;
              the sources available give either an unpublished report dated
              29 May 1820, or the completion of the demarcation of the new
              line on 19 Jul 1820. [1]
20 Oct 1820 Spain sells part of Florida to US for $5 million. [3]
19 Dec 1820 Alabama redefined some county borders, ending its erroneous
              overlap of Mississippi created on 6 Feb 1818. [1]
       1821 Lockport, New York founded. [7]
            Bridgeport, Connecticut founded [1]

 8 Feb 1821 Hamilton County, Illinois formed. [11]
12 Feb 1821 Montgomery County, Illinois formed. [11]
14 Feb 1821 Fayette County, Illinois formed. [11]
19 Feb 1821 The United States of America receives Florida from Spain in
              the Adams-Onis Treaty. [1]
22 Feb 1821 The Adams-Onis Treaty with Spain took effect. The many
              changes included: The border with the holdings of Spain was
              concretely defined; previously, it had been the watershed of
              the Mississippi River and, for Oregon Country, the Columbia
              River, whereas now it followed specific rivers and parallels.
              The new border placed the "Neutral Ground" in Louisiana.
              Florida was ceded to the United States, although the formal
              transfer would not happen until July. Arkansas Territory had
              created Miller County south of the Red River, and this area
              was now on the Spanish side of the border. However, as this was
              a change made solely by the territory, and not by the federal
              government, in this map it is considered a domestic dispute.
              With Spanish West Florida being ceded, the dispute between it
              and Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi was resolved. [1]
10 Jul 1821 East Florida was formally transferred to the United States by
              Spain. [1]
17 Jul 1821 West Florida was formally transferred to the United States by
              Spain. [1]
10 Aug 1821 The southeastern corner of Missouri Territory was admitted
              to the US as the 24th state, Missouri. The remainder became
              unorganized. Missouri did not include its northwestern triangle
              at this point, that being added later in the Platte Purchase. [1]

12 Jan 1825 A treaty with the Russian Empire established 54 degrees 40'
              north as the northern border of Oregon Country for American
              purposes; a separate treaty created the same border between
              Russia and the United Kingdom. This was likely the de facto
              border anyway. [1]
13 Jan 1825 Adams County, Illinois formed. [11]

              the Treaty of Ghent to arbitrate the disputed border between
              Maine and the United Kingdom, rendered his decision: Since
              reconciling the treaty with the maps given was too difficult,
              he drew a compromise line. The British government accepted it,
              but Maine protested, and on 19 Jan 1832 the American government

 9 Aug 1842 U.S./Canada border defined in Webster-Ashburton Treaty. [8]
10 Nov 1842 The Webster-Ashburton Treaty defined the border with the United
              Kingdom east of the Rocky Mountains. One source also mentions it
              very slightly altering the maritime boundary between Michigan and
              Wisconsin Territory. The treaty resolved the disputes over the
              northern borders of Maine and New Hampshire, the northeastern
              border of Wisconsin Territory, and Sugar Island with Michigan.
              The border between New York and Vermont on the one side, and the
              United Kingdom on the other, was clarified by the treaty. In
              1816, construction began on an unnamed fort nicknamed "Fort
              Blunder" on a peninsula in Lake Champlain that, while south of
              the surveyed border, was discovered to be north of 45 degrees
              north, which was the border set by the Treaty of Paris and
              thus in British territory. Consequently, construction on the
              fort was abandoned. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty specified
              that section of the border was to follow the surveyed line,
              rather than the exact parallel, thus moving the fort's area
              into the United States, and a new fort, Fort Montgomery, would
              be built on the spot in 1844. As the earlier line was surveyed,
              even though it did not match the definition, it was deemed to
              be the legitimate border. [1]

              had blocked the Tylers' treaties for these annexations. [18]

29 Dec 1845 The Republic of Texas was annexed and admitted as the
              twenty-eighth state, Texas. All of Texas was claimed by
              Mexico. While many sources state that Mexico recognized the
              independence of the eastern portion of Texas, the treaties
              were rejected by the Mexican government. Austin yields to
              Washington as federal capital while remaining capital of the
              state. Texas formally handed over sovereignty to the United
              States in a ceremony on 19 Feb 1846. The annexation led to
              the beginning of the Mexican-American War a few months later. [1]
31 Jan 1846 After the Milwaukee Bridge War, the United States towns of

15 Jun 1846 The Oregon Treaty established 49 degrees north west of the Lake
              of the Woods as the continental border (so it did not include
              Vancouver Island) with land held by the United Kingdom. The
              sharing of Oregon Country ended, and the United States portion
              became unorganized territory. The treaty was vague on which
              strait should be the border between Vancouver Island and the
              continent, thus causing a dispute over ownership of the San
              Juan Islands. It specified "through the middle of the said
              channel and of Fuca Straits, to the Pacific Ocean". [1]

              in the then-Mexican province of California. Declared during the
              Mexican-American War, the republic lasted less than a month. [1]
 5 Aug 1846 Oregon Treaty - The United States and Great Britain ended
              their dispute over the Oregon Territory with a compromise. [1]

              [3] All territory to the South became US territory. [1]
22 Aug 1846 the United States annexes New Mexico [8]
22 Sep 1846 Following the capture on 18 Aug 1846 of Santa Fe, the capital
              of the Mexican territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico, a code
              of laws known as the Kearny Code was created for the area. The
              region overlapped with Texas' claim, though Texas had little
              to no control over the area outside of its eastern quarter. [1]
28 Dec 1846 The portion of Iowa Territory south of 43 degrees 30' north
              and east of the Big Sioux River was admitted as the twenty-ninth

              War. [1] Under the terms of the treaty, the border would be set
              at the Rio Grande River. [18] Mexico ceded the Texas-claimed
              areas as well as a large area of land consisting of all of
              present-day California, Nevada, and Utah, most of Arizona,
              and portions of Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming. [1] The US
              paid Mexico $15 million for these territories. [18]

              thirtieth state, Wisconsin. The remainder became unorganized
              territory. However, the citizens of the remainder decided
              to continue on with a civil government, and even elected a
              delegate to the United States House of Representatives who
              would be seated on 15 Jan 1849, essentially making this region

 4 Jul 1848 The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American
              War and ceded a large parcel of land from Mexico, consisting of
              its territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico,
              and its claim to Texas. Due to a disagreement over the southern
              border of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico, a border dispute began. [1]
14 Aug 1848 Oregon Territory was organized from the unorganized territory
              that was formerly part of Oregon Country. [1]
       1849 Las Cruces, New Mexico founded [1]

13 Feb 1849 The boundary dispute between Iowa and Missouri known as the
              Honey War was resolved by the Supreme Court of the United
              States. The resulting border was the Sullivan Line that existed
              before the dispute, roughly splitting the two claims. [1]
 1 Mar 1849 Lambertville Town, Hunterdon County, New Jersey formed from
              West Amwell Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
 3 Mar 1849 Minnesota Territory was organized [1] [3] from the region
              that had been operating as de facto Wisconsin Territory, and
              unorganized territory east of the Missouri and White Earth
              Rivers. [1]
12 Mar 1849 A local government formed the State of Deseret and claimed a
              vast portion of the southwest, including most of the Mexican
              Cession. Though it petitioned to be admitted to the United
              States, the proposal was rejected and, in 1850, Utah Territory
              was formed instead. The claimed area overlapped slightly with
              Texas' claimed area, as well as part of Oregon Territory.

              government assuming $10 million of Texas's pre-annexation
              debt. The western portion of the Mexican Cession was admitted
              as the thirty-first state, California. The portion of the
              remainder north of 37 degrees north and west of the summit
              of the Rocky Mountains was organized as Utah Territory. Part
              of Utah Territory overlapped with the portion of Texas that
              would be purchased on 13 Dec 1850, but the law authorizing
              the purchase was passed on this day, so the borders of Utah
              Territory assumed the purchase will go through. [1]
            Territory of New Mexico created [3]
 9 Dec 1850 The United Kingdom ceded less than one acre of underwater
              rock known as Horseshoe Reef in Lake Erie near Buffalo, New
              York for a lighthouse. It was surrounded by British waters,
              thus creating a form of enclave. [1]
13 Dec 1850 The federal government purchased the western claims of Texas. New
              Mexico Territory was organized from the part of this land east of
              the Rio Grande, along with the remaining unorganized territory
              from the Mexican Cession. New Mexico Territory included all

              the U.S. agreed to buy some 45,000 square miles of land from
              Mexico for $10 million [19] to facilitate railroad building
              in the Southwest. [1]
       1854 parts of Delaware, Raritan and West Amwell Townships, Hunterdon

10 Jan 1854 William Walker proclaimed the independence of lower California,
              calling it the Republic of Sonora. A serious lack of supplies,
              discontent within his party and an unexpectedly strong
              resistance by the Mexican government quickly forced Walker
              to retreat and return to San Francisco where he was tried but
              quickly acquitted. [16]
30 May 1854 Kansas Territory was organized from unorganized territory north
              of 37 degrees north, and Nebraska Territory was organized north
              of 40 degrees north. Much of the remaining unorganized territory,
              east of 100 degrees west, became known as Indian Territory,
              designated as a place to resettle Indian tribes. A small strip
              between the Texas Panhandle and Kansas Territory was unclaimed,
              due to falling south of Kansas Territory's border but north of
              36 degrees 30' north established in the Missouri Compromise as
              the northern limit of slavery, and thus Texas could not have
              it. This became known as the Public Land Strip, or sometimes
              "No Man's Land". [1]
29 Jun 1854 Congress ratifies Gadsden Purchase, adds parts of New Mexico,
              Arizona [8]
30 Jun 1854 The United States purchased a large parcel from Mexico known
              as the Gadsden Purchase, as it offered a much better route
              for a southern transcontinental railroad. This resolved the
              border dispute, since the disputed land was included in the
              purchase. [1]
 2 Mar 1855 Snyder County, Pennsylvania formed from Union County,
              Pennsylvania [4]

              territories of Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, and
              Washington, with the name of Jefferson Territory. While never
              recognized by the federal government, it generally held control
              over the area until Colorado Territory was established, which
              adopted most of its laws. [1]

              the Guano Islands Act. Many additional islands were listed as
              bonded on this date, but based on the coordinates they were
              either phantoms or duplicates. In addition, Sarah Ann Island
              was claimed, which may have existed and would be sighted as
              late as 1917, but has since disappeared. [1]

              before it was to take effect, which sources say took place on
              this date; the only primary source found so far is a statement

              was transferred to Dakota Territory. [1]
30 May 1854 Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory were organized; the
              remaining unorganized land colloquially became known as Indian
              Territory. Kansas Territory consisted of present-day Kansas and
              eastern Colorado. Nebraska Territory consisted of present-day
              Nebraska, and parts of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South
              Dakota, and Wyoming. Indian Territory corresponds to eastern
              Oklahoma. [1]
            A peculiarity appeared at this time, when a small strip of
              land north of Texas was not officially assigned by any state
              or territory; this came to be called the Neutral Strip or "No
              Man's Land", which corresponds to the present-day panhandle
              of Oklahoma. [1]
31 Oct 1864 Nevada Territory was admitted as the thirty-sixth state,
              Nevada. [1]

 5 May 1865 The Confederate States cabinet met in Washington, Georgia,
              and dissolved. Military surrenders were scattered throughout
              1865, but the most important is regarded as that of the Army
              of Northern Virginia following the Battle of Appomattox Court
              House on 9 Apr. [1]
            Clinton Town, Hunterdon County, New Jersey formed within Clinton,

              transferred to Nevada. The law transferring the land was approved
              5 May 1866, but unlike the Utah Territory transfer of that day,
              this transfer was contingent on the state accepting it. [1]
 1 Mar 1867 Nebraska Territory was admitted as the thirty-seventh state,
              Nebraska. Lancaster, Nebraska is renamed Lincoln and becomes
              the state capital. [1]
30 Mar 1867 U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward [6] reaches agreement
              with Russia to purchase the territory of Alaska for $7.2
              million [2] [3] (about 2 cents an acre), [3] a deal ridiculed
              by critics as "Seward’s Folly." [2] [3]
 4 Apr 1867 Frenchtown Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey formed from
              Alexandria Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
 1 Jul 1867 Canada was formed from several British colonies, including
              New Brunswick, thus inheriting the dispute over Machias Seal
              Island and North Rock. [1]
28 Aug 1867 Midway Atoll was claimed. The largest island of Midway, Sand
              Island, had been claimed under the Guano Islands Act in 1858,
              but nothing more is known about this. [1]
18 Oct 1867 Alaska formally transferred to the United States from the Russian
              Empire [1] [33] for $7.2 million (US$126,274,285.71 in 2018)
              and designated the Department of Alaska. (The United States
              Senate approved the purchase on 9 Apr 1867.) New Archangel
              (Novoarkhangelsk now Sitka) is the capital. Due to a vague
              description and lack of quality surveying, the southeastern
              border with British holdings was unclear and disputed. [1]
       1868 Phoenix, Arizona founded. [1]

            Wyoming Territory was organized from portions of Dakota,
              Idaho, and Utah Territories. The territory would remain
              under the jurisdiction of the Dakota Territory until its own
              government was organized on 19 May 1869. The act organizing
              Wyoming Territory became law on this date, but it is unclear
              if the territory could be considered "organized" until 19 May
              1869, as the act specifies it was not to take effect until a
              government is organized; however, all sources use this date
              as the creation, and most use it for the organization, of the
              territory. A tiny portion of the Dakota Territory was erroneously
              left behind on the western side of Wyoming Territory. [1]
12 Aug 1868 The list of bonded guano island claims mentions "Islands in
              Caribbean Sea not named" bonded on this date, but it is unknown
              what this is referring to. [1]

              has claimed it throughout its history. [1]

              specific area was very small and poorly documented. [1]
13 Sep 1880 Western Triangle Island, claimed by Mexico, was claimed by
              the United States under the Guano Islands Act. The list of
              bonded claims also mentions a "De Anes" island claimed on
              this date, with coordinates matching Isla de Aves; however,
              the same list points out that the claim to "Aves Island"
              was found to be invalid. [1]
 5 Feb 1881 Phoenix, AZ incorporates [3]

              State Street) between the two cities was either the northern
              sidewalk of the street, or down the middle of the street;
              Tennessee's cession of the northern half of the street laid
              the issue to rest. [1]
23 Mar 1901 The president of the First Philippine Republic, Emilio Aguinaldo,
              was captured, and the republic was dissolved. [1]
            The islands of Cagayan de Sulu and Sibutu, and their associated
              islands, were purchased from Spain and assigned to the
              Philippines. The borders specified in the Treaty of Paris of
              1898 had excluded these islands; the new treaty simply ceded "any
              and all islands belonging to the Philippine Archipelago". [1]
12 Jun 1901 Cuba Becomes US Protectorate - Cuba had been occupied
              since the US victory in the Spanish-American War. The
              Cuban Constitutional Convention adopted a resolution that
              prohibited Cuba from entering into any agreement that would
              limit its independence. The amendment also stated that, if
              Cuban independence were threatened, the US would intervene. [18]
20 May 1902 The Republic of Cuba gains independence from the United States 
              of America. Havana is the capital. Tomas Estrada Palma becomes
              the country's first President. [1]
20 Oct 1903 The Alaska Boundary Dispute was a territorial dispute between
              the United States and Canada (then a British Dominion with its
              foreign affairs controlled from London), and at a subnational
              level between Alaska on the US side and British Columbia and
              the Yukon on the Canadian side. It was resolved by arbitration,
              generally favoring the American claim. [1]
10 Dec 1903 Land along southern Guantanamo Bay was leased in perpetuity
              from Cuba for use as a naval base; the treaty took effect 23
              Feb 1903, and the formal handover occurred on this date. [1]
       1904 Sussex County, NJ - Fredon Township was set off from parts of
              Stillwater, Andover, Green, Hampton and Newton, establishing
              the current township boundaries of Sussex County. [5]
 4 May 1904 The United States took ownership of the Panama Canal Zone. At
              this stage, only the most basic borders were defined; it was
              a zone surrounding the canal on each side for five miles, but
              excluded the cities of Colon and Panama City, which remained
              exclaves of Panama, as well as the water for their harbors. The
              Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty granting it to the United States was
              ratified on 26 Feb 1904. A formal border agreement, which also
              gave the Canal Zone some land and a lighthouse in northwest
              Colon, would be ratified on 15 Jun 1904. [1]
16 Jul 1904 The Manu'a islands were formally ceded to the United States and
              added to Naval Station, Tutuila. The United States had claimed
              the islands on 19 Feb 1900. The treaty would be ratified by
              Congress on 20 Feb 1929. [1]
12 Dec 1904 The "Taft Agreement" was made with Panama on 3 Dec with one
              of its sections refining the maritime boundary of the harbor
              of Panama City and the Panama Canal Zone. It became effective
              12 Dec. [1]
       1905 Las Vegas, Nevada founded [1]
 1 Jan 1905 Vailsburg Borough was annexed by Newark, providing an exception
              to the growing New Jersey practice of the era of fragmentation
              of larger communities into smaller ones. [17]
10 Feb 1905 The border between Arkansas and Indian Territory was slightly
              adjusted near Fort Smith, Arkansas, transferring a small amount
              of land on the east side of the Poteau River to Arkansas. [1]
30 Mar 1905 Bloomsbury Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey formed from
              Bethlehem Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
15 May 1905 Las Vegas is founded [1] [8] when 110 acres (0.45 km2), in
              what later would become downtown, are auctioned off. [1]
       1906 The American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company performed an
              unauthorized diversion of the Rio Grande, which moved a 413-acre
              (167 ha) tract of land, including the American village of Rio
              Rico, south of the river. Since the 1845 Border Treaty all
              land south of the Rio Grande was Mexican. Mexican authorities
              unknowingly assumed control of the area, which became known
              as the Horcon Tract. [1]
            Virginia Beach, Virginia founded [1]
 9 Oct 1907 Las Cruces, New Mexico is incorporated. [1]
16 Nov 1907 Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were combined and
              admitted to the US as the 46th state, Oklahoma. [1]
11 Apr 1908 A boundary treaty with the United Kingdom on behalf of Canada
              redefined the maritime borders between the United States and
              Canada. Among other changes, this "de-enclaved" Horseshoe
              Reef in Lake Erie by making the water around it contiguous
              with the water on the American side of the border. [1]
 1 Jan 1909 The new Constitution of Michigan included some area of Wisconsin
              within its definition of Michigan. [1]
11 Feb 1909 Junction Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey renamed Hampton
              Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey by a Resolution of Council
              [13]
 7 Apr 1910 Flemington Village, Hunterdon County, New Jersey became
              Flemington Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey and separated
              from Raritan Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
20 Aug 1910 A boundary treaty with the United Kingdom on behalf of Canada
              addressed a slight uncertainty in the maritime border in
              Passamaquoddy Bay between Maine and Canada. The border was
              adjusted to run east of Pope's Folly Island, which previously
              lay on the border line, and had been the subject of some debate
              for many years. [1]
15 Apr 1911 Milford Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey formed from
              Holland Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
17 Jul 1911 Naval Station, Tutuila, was renamed American Samoa; the station
              continued to operate separate from territorial governance
              until 1951. [1]
 6 Jan 1912 New Mexico Territory was admitted to the US as the 47th state,
              New Mexico. [1]
14 Feb 1912 Arizona Territory was admitted to the US as the 48th state,
              Arizona; [1] President William Howard Taft signed the
              proclamation. [19]
14 Aug 1912 The District of Alaska was reorganized as the Alaska
              Territory. [1]
31 Jan 1913 New Mexico filed suit in the Supreme Court against Texas over the
              "Country Club Dispute," questioning whether the present course
              or the 1850 course of the Rio Grande should be their border. [1]
       1914 Anchorage, Alaska founded [1]
28 Jan 1914 Beverly Hills, Ca, is incorporated. [3]
 5 Aug 1914 The Corn Islands were leased from Nicaragua for a period of 99
              years; however, this was not a full transfer of sovereignty,
              and the islands were never administered as an insular area. [1]
 1 May 1915 The borders of the Panama Canal Zone were explicitly
              defined. Whereas the original definition was a simple corridor
              surrounding the canal, this treaty specified the actual
              border. Among the changes this caused were: a slice of Canal
              Zone was ceded to Panama so Panama City would be connected with
              the rest of the country; the middle island of the Las Tres
              Hermanas Islands, which marked the border of Panama City's
              harbor, was wholly made part of Canal Zone; Gatun Lake and
              other surrounding waters were formally annexed to the territory;
              and an area of northwest Colon was ceded to Canal Zone. [1]
27 May 1915 Under Article II of the 1903 Treaty, the United States
              expropriated from Panama several areas around the mouth of
              the Rio Chagres, annexing them to the Panama Canal Zone. [1]
 8 Dec 1915 The United States expropriated from Panama a triangle of land,
              which included the historic Fort San Lorenzo, between the Rio
              Chagres, Caribbean Sea and the Panama Canal Zone, to which it
              was annexed. [1]
       1916 Truth Or Consequences, New Mexicofounded, originally named Hot
              Springs. [1]
17 Jan 1916 Navassa Island was formally claimed for lighthouse purposes. [1]
31 Mar 1917 The Danish Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark and
              renamed the United States Virgin Islands. [1]
 2 Apr 1918 Califon Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey formed from
              Tewksbury and Lebanon Townships, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
12 Jul 1918 The United States expropriated from Panama 2.6 hectares of
              land at Punta Paitilla in Panama City and annexed it to the
              Panama Canal Zone. That area was enlarged to about 50 hectares
              within several months. [1]
21 Aug 1918 The United States expropriated from Panama land between the
              Rio Chagres and the Quebrada Majagual and annexed it to the
              Panama Canal Zone. [1]
13 Sep 1918 Minnesota and Wisconsin exchanged islands in the Mississippi
              River: Island Seventytwo was transferred to Winona, Minnesota,
              and Barron's Island was transferred to La Crosse, Wisconsin. [1]
26 Mar 1919 Glen Gardner Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey formed from
              Lebanon and Bethlehem Townships, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
18 Sep 1919 The island of Largo Remo was annexed to the Panama Canal Zone
              under the United States right of expropriation in the 1903
              Canal Treaty. [1]
16 Jun 1920 Fifteen hectares on the island of Taboga Island were annexed
              to the Panama Canal Zone. [1]
30 Jun 1921 The "Wedge" dispute between Delaware and Pennsylvania was
              resolved in Delaware's favor. The disputed land had generally
              been administered by Delaware, even electing a member of the
              Delaware legislature in the mid-19th century, but federal
              maps had included the land as part of Pennsylvania at least
              as late as 1900. The states had agreed on a resolution, and it
              was affirmed by an act of Congress on this date. Some sources,
              contemporary and modern, note that, in the original process of
              resurveying the border in 1892, a very thin, horn-shaped region
              along the arc was transferred from Delaware to Pennsylvania;
              however, no federal maps found reflect this, and it is unclear
              if this transfer actually occurred. [1]
10 May 1922 Kingman Reef was formally annexed. [1]
 8 Oct 1923 Michigan expanded its claim to Wisconsin territory, though
              Wisconsin never lost control over the area. [1]
15 Nov 1923 The Swan Islands were claimed by Honduras. [1]
 1 Feb 1924 The future area for Madden Lake was annexed to the Panama
              Canal Zone under the United States right of expropriation in
              the 1903 Canal Treaty. [1]
 4 Mar 1925 Swains Island was added to American Samoa. [1]
13 Mar 1925 incorporation of Milford Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey
              confirmed [13]
17 Jul 1925 The border with Canada was adjusted in several places. The only
              change to a land border redefined how the border between the
              Lake of the Woods and the Rocky Mountains should be considered;
              previously, the border followed the curve of the parallel between
              each border monument, while the treaty changed this to straight
              lines between each monument. Through this, the United States
              netted a gain of between 30 and 35 acres of land. Due to the
              extremely small shift, the lack of specific documentation of
              where the changes occurred, and the lack of any human impact,
              this change is not mapped. There was also a change to the
              border in the Lake of the Woods; due to inaccurate surveying,
              the previous border intersected itself several times in the
              lake, creating enclaves of United States water surrounded
              by Canadian water. The treaty changed the border to use the
              southernmost intersection as the northwestern point of the
              Lake of the Woods. Finally, the maritime border in the Bay of
              Fundy was adjusted, netting Canada roughly 9 acres of water. [1]
 1 Mar 1926 The Supreme Court of the United States resolved the conflict
              between Michigan and Wisconsin in the favor of Wisconsin. [1]
26 Mar 1926 Lebanon Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey formed from
              Clinton Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
29 Jul 1926 Johnston Atoll was established as a federal bird refuge and
              placed under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of
              Agriculture. The atoll had originally been claimed by both the
              United States and Hawaii in 1858, but little activity apart
              from guano mining had taken place, and it had been largely
              abandoned for decades. [1]
22 Nov 1926 The Supreme Court of the United States defined the border
              between Michigan and Wisconsin, transferring all islands
              south of the Quinnesec Falls on the Menominee River to
              Wisconsin, and all islands north of the falls to Michigan;
              it is unknown specifically which islands were transferred
              in this fashion. However, an error in the border description
              introduced a small overlap between the two states over several
              islands in Lake Michigan north of the Door Peninsula. [1]
18 Jul 1927 The United States expropriated from Panama another 33 hectares
              of land on the islands of Taboga and Taboguilla and annexed
              them to the Panama Canal Zone. [1]
26 Oct 1927 Two bancos along the Colorado River were ceded from Mexico to
              Arizona. [1]
 5 Dec 1927 The "Country Club Dispute" between New Mexico and Texas was
              resolved in Texas's favor. [1]
 4 Apr 1928 The Island of Palmas Case was decided in the favor of the
              Netherlands, ceding Palmas to the Dutch East Indies. [1]
24 Sep 1928 The United States expropriated from Panama three hectares of
              land at El Cerro de Doscientos Pies ("200-Foot Hill") near
              Las Minas Bay and annexed it to the Panama Canal Zone. [1]
22 Jul 1930 The United States expropriated from Panama 25 hectares on
              Jicarita Island and 60 hectares at Punta Morro de Puercos and
              annexed them to the Panama Canal Zone. [1]
       1931 part of Glen Gardner Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey and
              Bethlehem Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey to Hampton
              Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
            part of Union Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey to Clinton
              Town, Hunterdon County, New Jersey [13]
15 Apr 1931 The United States expropriated from Panama additional areas
              around the soon-to-be-built Madden Dam and annexed them to
              the Panama Canal Zone. [1]
27 Apr 1931 incorporation of Flemington Borough, Hunterdon County, New
              Jersey confirmed [13]
 3 May 1932 The United States adjusted the border at Punta Paitilla in the
              Canal Zone, returning a small amount of land to Panama. This
              was the site for a planned new American embassy, which had to
              be built on foreign soil. [1]
17 May 1932 Porto Rico was renamed Puerto Rico. [1]
13 Dec 1932 The Mangsee Islands and seven of the Turtle Islands were ceded
              by the United Kingdom from North Borneo to the Philippines. The
              islands were supposed to be included in the 1900 transfer of
              islands from Spain to the United States. Per the terms of the
              treaty, the United Kingdom continued to administer the islands
              until requested, and after its independence, the Philippine
              government made such a request and took control. [1]
29 May 1933 The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the border
              between New Hampshire and Vermont was the low water mark of
              the west bank of the Connecticut River; Vermont had sought to
              have the border placed in the middle of the river. [1]
13 Nov 1933 A treaty created the Rio Grande Rectification Project, which,
              from 1935 to 1938, straightened and stabilized the path of the
              Rio Grande through the El Paso-Juarez Valley. By the end of
              the project, 174 parcels had been transferred between Mexico
              and Texas, each side receiving an equal area of land. [1]
29 Dec 1934 Kingman Reef was placed under the jurisdiction of the United
              States Department of the Navy. [1]
26 Mar 1935 Jarvis Island is transferred from the United Kingdom to the
              United States. [1]
15 Nov 1935 The United States territory of the Philippines becomes the
              semi-independent Commonwealth of the Philippines. [21]
16 Mar 1936 The de jure overlap between Michigan and Wisconsin was resolved
              by the Supreme Court of the United States. [1]
13 May 1936 Baker Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island were formally
              annexed and placed under the jurisdiction of the United States
              Department of the Interior, ending the United Kingdom's claim
              to Jarvis Island. [1]
22 Jun 1936 The U.S. Virgin Islands were organized into a civil
              territory. [1]
 8 Mar 1938 The United States claims the Canton and Enderbury Islands. [1]
16 Aug 1939 This is the earliest date so far discovered for when the
              United States began claiming Fakaofo, Funafuti, Hull Island,
              Niulakita, Nukufetau and Nukulaelae. [1]
10 Dec 1941 Governor George McMillin surrendered Guam to the Japanese
              military. [1]
23 Dec 1941 The garrison on Wake Island surrendered to the Japanese
              military. [1]
26 Mar 1942 The government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines
              evacuated from the territory in the face of Japanese advance. A
              government-in-exile would be established in Washington, D.C. on
              17 May 1942. The United States Army Forces in the Far East
              would surrender on 9 Apr 1942, following the Battle of Bataan,
              and the final military holdouts would surrender on 6 May 1942
              following the Battle of Corregidor. [1]
14 Oct 1943 The Second Philippine Republic was established as a puppet
              state of Japan. [1]
10 Aug 1944 Guam was captured from Japan. [1]
17 Aug 1945 The Second Philippine Republic, in exile in Tokyo since 3
              Apr 1945, was dissolved. The process of re-establishing the
              Commonwealth government on Philippine soil had started on 23
              Oct 1944. [1]
 4 Sep 1945 The Japanese garrison on Wake Island surrendered to the United
              States. [1]
 4 Jul 1946 The Commonwealth of the Philippines became independent as the
              Republic of the Philippines. [1]
18 Jul 1947 The United Nations entrusted the Trust Territory of the Pacific
              Islands to the United States. [1]
 1 Jan 1949 The Tokelau Islands were incorporated into New Zealand, which
              inherited the claims on Atafu, Fakaofo and Nukunono. [1]
 1 Aug 1950 Guam was organized into a civil territory. [1]
 3 Aug 1950 Kansas and Missouri exchanged small portions of land along the
              Missouri River due to shifts in the river following a flood
              in 1944. [1]
       1952 Norwichtown, Connecticut and Norwich, Connecticut consolidated [1]
       1954 boundary between East Amwell and West Amwell Townships,
              Hunterdon County, New Jersey clarified [13]
11 Apr 1955 Panama's corridor connecting Colon with the rest of Panama was
              realigned within the Panama Canal Zone. Several three-dimensional
              "tubes" of sovereignty were also created, allowing Panamanian
              bridges to pass over rivers and a highway at several locations
              within the Canal Zone. [1]
23 Aug 1955 Several border locations of the Panama Canal Zone were
              redefined. Punta Paitilla, the land held on Taboga Island,
              and the remaining American holdings in Colon and Panama City
              were ceded to Panama. [1]
 3 Jan 1959 The Alaska Territory was admitted as the forty-ninth state,
              Alaska. [1]
21 Aug 1959 Most of Hawaii Territory was admitted as the fiftieth state,
              Hawaii. Palmyra Atoll was excluded from statehood and remained
              a territory. [1]
25 Aug 1961 About 20 acres of land was transferred from Minnesota to North

       1970 The city of Rio Rico, Texas, was ceded to Mexico in the Boundary
              Treaty of 1970. The handover officially took place in 1977
              and the city was added to the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. [1]
 1 Mar 1977 The United States claimed maritime borders west of the Strait
              of Juan de Fuca, within the Dixon Entrance, and in the Beaufort

              Rio Grande in areas near Presidio and Hidalgo, Texas, including
              the Horcon Tract, on which the town of Rio Rico was located,
              and Beaver Island near Roma, Texas. In addition, Mexico ceded
              823 acres (3.33 km2) to the U.S., while the U.S. ceded 2,177
              acres (8.81 km2) to Mexico, primarily to straighten sections
              of the Rio Grande for flood control. [1]
16 Dec 1977 A treaty defining the maritime border with Cuba was signed;
              though it has never been ratified by the United States Senate,
              it is provisionally enforced by agreement renewed every two
              years. [1]
 1 Oct 1979 The Panama Canal Zone was ceded to Panama. The United States and
              Panama continued to share operational control of the canal until
              31 Dec 1999 when it would be fully turned over to Panama. The
              United States retained control over several hundred specified
              areas to be turned over in piecemeal fashion over the years. [1]
24 Nov 1980 The maritime border between the United States and Venezuela
              was defined. [1]
17 Sep 1981 The United States recognized the sovereignty of Colombia over
              Roncador Bank and Serrana Bank, and the claim on Quita Sueno
              Bank was abandoned by the United States, as it was no longer
              above the seas at high tide, and thus the government considered
              it unclaimable. [1]
 3 Sep 1983 The United States recognized the sovereignty of the New Zealand
              territory of Tokelau over Atafu, Fakaofo, and Nukunono, and
              defined the maritime border with Tokelau. [1]
 8 Sep 1983 The United States recognized the sovereignty of the Cook

              Birnie Island, Canton Island, Caroline Island, Christmas Island,
              Enderbury Island, Flint Island, Gardner Island, Hull Island,
              Malden Island, McKean Island, Phoenix Island, Starbuck Island,
              Sydney Island and Vostok Island. [1]

              the maritime border should be in the Gulf of Maine between the
              United States and Canada. No land changed hands. The scope
              of the case did not include the sovereignty of Machias Seal
              Island, but the judgment enabled defining the extent of the
              disputed water area around that island (an area of 210 square
              nautical miles). [1]
21 Oct 1986 The Marshall Islands District of the Trust Territory of the
              Pacific Islands became independent as the Republic of the
              Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islanders had claimed Wake
              Island as part of their territory since at least 1973, and
              continued that after independence. [1]
 3 Nov 1986 Most of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands was dissolved
              by the United Nations. The districts of Chuuk, Pohnpei, and
              Yap became independent as the Federated States of Micronesia
              (Kolonia on Pohnpei is the capital). The Mariana Islands
              District, having already been taking moves towards integration
              with the United States, became a territory of the United States,
              the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. [1]
13 Nov 1986 The Compact of Free Association becomes law, granting the
              Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands
              independence from the United States. [1]
 1 Jun 1990 The maritime border between the United States and the Soviet
              Union was provisionally defined. The two countries agreed
              on this date to abide by the terms of the treaty pending its
              ratification and entry into force, but while it was ratified by
              the United States Senate on 16 Sep 1991, it is unknown if either
              the Soviet Union or its successor state, Russia, ratified it. [1]
 1 Oct 1994 The remaining district of the Trust Territory of the Pacific
              Islands, the Palau District, became independent as the Republic
              of Palau, dissolving the TTPI. [1]
 1 Jun 1995 The maritime border between the United States and territories
              of the United Kingdom in the Caribbean Sea was defined. [1]

              of the Interior. [1]

              defined. [1]
31 Dec 1999 At noon [8] the United States Government hands control of the
              Panama Canal (as well all the adjacent land to the canal known
              as the Panama Canal Zone) to Panama. [1] [8] This act complied
              with the signing of the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties. [1]
17 Jan 2001 The maritime border between the United States and Mexico on
              the continental shelf in the western Gulf of Mexico beyond
              200 nautical miles was defined. [1]
24 Nov 2009 Six islands along the Rio Grande were ceded from Texas to
              Mexico, and three islands and two bancos were ceded from Mexico
              to Texas. The transfer, which had been pending for 20 years,
              was the first application of Article III of the 1970 Boundary
              Treaty. [1]
23 Sep 2014 The maritime border between the United States and Niue was
              defined. The treaty was signed on 13 May 1997, but it was not
              ratified by the United States until at least 2002, and the
              United Nations shows it as entering into force on this date. [1]
 1 Jan 2017 The border between North Carolina and South Carolina was
              clarified following years of surveys and negotiation, moving
              19 homes across state lines. [1]
