       1754 The French and Indian War begins in North America. [2] [3] [4]
              It becomes the Seven Years War when fighting spreads to Europe
              in 1756. [2] For almost nine years, [3] [4] a war was fought
              between British and French soldiers in North America. The
              British were victorious, and France was forced to cede a
              new sense of independent identity amongst the colonists,
              who were forced to defend the colonies with limited help from
              the motherland. [3]
            Fort de Chartres is renovated and improved. [2]
   Jan 1754 The first skirmish of the French and Indian War occured when

              (now Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). [2]
 6 Jan 1754 George Washington and Christopher Gist arrive Wills Creek

              Governor Dinwiddie's letter. There is still a long way to go
              to get the French reply to Governor Dinwiddie at Williamsburg,
              Virginia. [2]
16 Jan 1754 George Washington arrives at Williamsburg, Virginia, and gives to
              Governor Dinwiddie the reply by the French commanding officer
              at Fort LeBoeuf. 77 days have gone by between the departure
              of Dinwiddie's letter from Williamsburg, and the arrival
              of the reply. This eleven-week time is typical of the slow
              communications of those times; in fact this was quick work,
              considering that the trip was made in winter with deep snow
              on the ground and ice in the rivers for most of the time,
              and Washington was travelling through primeval wilderness
              without roads. [2]

              George Washington successfully defeats a party of French
              and Indian scouts in southwest Pennsylvania [4] [5] (Battle
              of Jumonville Glen [2] [4] in what is now Fayette County)
              [4] as Virginia attempts to lay claim to the territory for
              its own settlers. The action snowballed into a world war
              (The French and Indian War, 1754-1763) and began the military
              career of the first American commander in chief. [4] [5]

              west outpost in North America. [2]

              is also destroyed. [2]

              Mohawk King Hendrick. A later engagement would be called the

              the Seven Years War in Europe and Canada, and the French
              and Indian War in the United States. [2] England hoped to
              conquer Canada. The final defeat of the French came in 1763
              with the British victory at the Battle of Quebec on the Plains
              of Abraham. [8]
10 Jul 1756 Col. George Washington holds a Council of War at Fort Cumberland
              to discuss the chain of English forts that is to be built
              across western Virginia from the Maryland border to the North
              Carolina border.  It is hoped that this chain of forts will

              situated along the Allegheny River approximately forty miles
              upriver from the forks of the Ohio. During a fierce engagement,
              Armstrong's force burned the eastern portion of Kittanning
              and several surrounding cornfields, destroyed a significant

              warriors, including the notorious war leader Captain Jacobs. [2]
12 Oct 1756 Abandoned Fort Lawrence is burned. As the British army was now
              using the more substantial facility at Fort Cumberland (the
              former Fort Beausejour), British forces decided to demolish
              the abandoned works at Fort Lawrence to prevent the facility
              being used as shelter by Acadians who may have escaped to
              nearby forests. [2]

              Creek (Putnam's Creek) that runs into Lake Champlain almost
              exactly half-way between the French forts named Ticonderoga
              and Crown Point. Unfortunately for Rogers, the French were
              travelling in two groups a few minutes apart, two sleighs
              in the first group and eight in the second. Rogers Rangers
              attack the first group before they see the second coming. The
              sound of gunshots alarms the second group who retreat to
              Fort Ticonderoga and warn the French soldiers there. The
              French send men under Captain Basserode, who overtake Rogers
              near Carillon. A pitched battle is fought, a seesaw affair
              until Rogers orders his rangers to disperse into the night
              (a common ranger tactic).  The Rangers lose fourteen killed,
              six wounded and have another six taken prisoner. Major Rogers
              himself is wounded twice. Rogers and his surviving men make
              it back to Fort William Henry to recover. [2]
18 Mar 1757 Fort William Henry repels a French attack. [2]
   Apr 1757 William Pitt is forced to resign as Prime Minister of England. [2]
   Jun 1757 The elder William Pitt (1708-1778), the first Earl of Chatham, was
              brought into the British government as secretary of state (under
              an arrangement that gave him the effective decision-making
              power for military and diplomatic affairs). One of the
              first things he did was to replace tentative and ineffectual
              military commanders with younger men charged with carrying
              out a dynamic offensive strategy. [2]
   Jul 1757 Fort Carillon is completed. French General Montcalm uses the
              new Fort Carillon as a base from which to launch his attack
              on British Fort William Henry on Lake George. [2]

              Breton Island, Nova Scotia, is sieged [2] [4] for a second
              time by the British, having been returned to the French after
              a previous occupation in 1745. (This is the largest battle
              in North America until the American Civil War over 100 years
              later and is still the largest amphibious invasion in North
              American history.) [2] After being used to stage attacks on
              French Canada the following year, British soldiers reduce
              the fortress to rubble to prevent its return to the French
              a second time. The British take control of the Gulf of Saint
              Lawrence. [4]

              head towards Fort Carillon (Ticonderoga). [1] They attacked
              the fort on July 8th taking a great number of casualties. [1]
              [2] The day ended in defeat for the British [1] [2] [4]

              Some 3,500 Frenchmen defeated the British army [8] (lead by
