       1812 The War of 1812 begins with a poorly-coordinated three-pronged
              U.S. invasion of Canada by badly trained and poorly led American
              forces, which fails on all three fronts. The U.S. enjoys
              more success on the high seas, where its warships win a
              series of single-ship duels with the Royal Navy, and American
              privateers enjoy an early and rich harvest of unsuspecting
              British merchant ships. [2]
            The War of 1812 is one of the forgotten wars of the United
              States. The war lasted for over two years, and while it ended
              much like it started - in stalemate - it was in fact a war
              that once and for all confirmed American Independence. The
              offensive actions of the United States failed in every attempt
              to capture Canada. On the other hand, the British army was
              successfully stopped when it attempted to capture Baltimore and
              New Orleans. There were a number of American naval victories in
              which American vessels proved themselves superior to similarly
              sized British vessels. These victories coming after victories
              in the Quasi War (an even more forgotten war) launched American
              naval tradition. [4]

18 Jun 1812 America declared war on Great Britain, [1] [3] [6] [12]
              and is signed by President James Madison. [3] War of 1812
              begins. [3] [6] [12] New Jersey's role in the conflict was
              largely relegated to militia duty in coastal defense, although
              several New Jerseyans of note, including Zebulon Pike, William
              Bainbridge and James Lawrence, served in the army and navy, and
              a regular army regiment, the Fifteenth United States Infantry,
              was raised in the state. [6] The War of 1812 ends (in 1815)
              in a draw, except that Native Americans lose power. [3]
23 Jun 1812 War of 1812: Great Britain revokes the restrictions on American
              commerce, thus eliminating one of the chief reasons for going
              to war. [3]
22 Jun 1812 A mob in Baltimore destroys the printing offices of an anti-war

              which escapes to take word of the outbreak of war to Halifax,
              Canada. [2]
29 Jun 1812 Schooners Sophia and Island Packet taken by the British in the
              St. Lawrence River. [3]

              [3] from Detroit. [1]
15 Jul 1812 British squadron captures USS Nautilus: Four days after sailing
              from New York, the brig Nautilus, commanded by Lieutenant
              William Crane, encounters a British squadron consisting of
              the frigates Shannon, Guerriere, Belvidera, and Aeolus,
              and the ship of the line Africa. After a spirited chase,
              the British force Nautilus to surrender. [2]
16 Jul 1812 Battle of River Canard. [3]
17 Jul 1812 British capture Fort Mackinac: [1] [2] [3] In the northwest, news
              of war reaches the British before the Americans. In response,
              50 British regulars, 180 local fur traders, 280 Ottawas and
              Ojibwes under John Askin, Jr. of the Indian Department for
              British North America, and 115 Menominees, Ochethi Šakowiŋs,
              and Ho-Chunks under fur trader Robert Dickson, land on Mackinac
              Island in Michigan Territory and train their cannon on the fort
              from the heights above. Surprised, outnumbered, and fearing
              attack by members of the indigenous nations if they resist,
              the Americans surrender without firing a shot. 57 Americans
              captured. Loss of the fort emboldens many indigenous people
              to join the British in the war. [2]
19 Jul 1812 Attack at Sackets Harbor, New York. [3]
   Aug 1812 British and American negotiators met at Ghent, Belgium to
              negotiate a settlement in the War of 1812. They reached an
              agreement that restored all territory as it had been before
              the war - without resolving the territorial issues. [4]
 5 Aug 1812 Skirmish near Brownstown, Michigan. [1] [3]
 8 Aug 1812 British General Isaac Brock embarks at Port Dover for the relief
              of Amherstburg. [3]
            Battle of Maguaga. [3]
15 Aug 1812 British forces bombard Detroit. [1]
            Fort Dearborn massacre. [3]
16 Aug 1812 British capture Detroit: [1] [2] [3] The surrender of Fort
              Detroit is the first major U.S. defeat of the War of 1812. 7
              Americans killed, 1,593 Americans captured. After initially
              invading Canada, U.S. forces under Brigadier General William
              Hull withdraw to Michigan Territory and take refuge in Fort
              Detroit. British General Isaac Brock brilliantly uses his force
              of regulars and militia, as well as warriors from the Wyandot,
              Ottawa, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, Shawnee, Ho-Chunk, Sauk, Menominee,
              and Grand River Iroquois nations led by Chief Tecumseh, to
              persuade General Hull to surrender, warning of an attack by
              militant members of the indigenous nations if he refuses. Many
              U.S. soldiers under Hull are angry at the surrender. The
              defeat ends U.S. invasion plans in the Old Northwest for the
              remainder of the year and undermines American morale. [2]
19 Aug 1812 USS Constitution defeats HMS Guerriere: [1] [2] [3] [7]
              After narrowly escaping from a British squadron in a heroic
              multi-day chase off the Atlantic Coast in July, the U.S. frigate
              Constitution defeats the British frigate Guerriere. British
              killed 15, wounded 63, missing 24. Americans killed 7, wounded
              7. Because British cannon balls appear to bounce off the
              American ship's sides, [2] Constitution earns the nickname
              "Old Ironsides." [2] [3] [7] With four successful cruises,
              Constitution becomes the most famous U.S. ship of the War
              of 1812 and is still maintained as a commissioned U.S. Navy
              vessel today. [2]
            The Great Louisiana hurricane struck New Orleans, damaging both
              the U.S. and the British fleet. [3]

 7 Oct 1812 U.S. General James Winchester's army arrives near Fort
              Defiance. [3]
 9 Oct 1812 In a naval engagement on Lake Erie, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Jesse
              Elliott captures the brigs, Caledonia and Detroit. [3]
13 Oct 1812 British victory at Queenston Heights: [1] [2] In the Battle
              at Queenston Heights, [2] [3] the United States suffers its
              second major defeat of the war. To secure a foothold in Canada
              before the onset of winter, U.S. forces cross the Niagara River
              and seize Queenston Heights. Although initially successful,
              reinforcements are not forthcoming because American militiamen
              refuse to cross the Canadian border. The British, under Major
              General Isaac Brock, and their Grand River Iroquois allies
              under Captain John Norton, assault the Heights and defeat and
              capture the bulk of the American invasion force. Although
              victorious, [2] General Brock is killed. [2] [8] British
              killed 21, wounded 85, captured 17. Americans killed 100,
              wounded 170, captured 958. [2]

            HMS Poictiers captures USS Wasp. [3]
25 Oct 1812 USS United States [2] [3] [6] commanded by Stephen Decatur, [3]
              [5] captures HMS Macedonian: [2] [3] [5] Cruising between the
              Azores and Cape Verde Islands, the U.S. frigate United States
              defeats the British frigate Macedonian. British killed 36,
              wounded 68. Americans killed 5, wounded 7. In a battle lasting
              about two hours, American gunnery severely damages Macedonian's
              rigging and hull, and the British ship surrenders. The Americans
              sail Macedonian home as a prize of war, and the British ship
              is incorporated into the U.S. Navy as a high-profile trophy
              ship that publicizes the U.S. victory against the "Mistress
              of the Seas." [2]

              Mississinewa. [3]

28 Dec 1812 William Henry Harrison formally resigns as Governor of Indiana
              Territory and takes the rank of Brigadier General. [1]
29 Dec 1812 USS Constitution defeats HMS Java: [1] [2] After returning
              to Boston in September, Constitution sails for the South
              Atlantic. On December 29, off the coast of Brazil, Constitution
              defeats the British frigate Java. After a fierce battle lasting
              almost three hours, the British surrender. British killed
              22-60, wounded 101. Americans killed 9, wounded 26. Java
              suffers heavy damage, forcing the Americans to set it on
              fire and sink it after the battle. The three U.S. frigate
              victories in 1812 eventually induce the Royal Navy to change
              its tactics. In 1813, the Royal Navy orders its frigates not
              to engage American frigates alone. [2]
            Paul Hamilton resigns as Secretary of the Navy. [3]
       1813 More battles are fought than any other year of the War of
              1812. The Americans secure the Old Northwest, but the British
              prevail elsewhere. American losses in men, money, and equipment
              are steep. Although no one realizes it at the time, 1813 is
              the high water mark of American attempts to conquer Canada. [2]
            Tensions between the National Creek Muscogees (who favor
              assimilation into American society) and the "Red Sticks"
              faction (who advocate retaining traditional ways) erupts in
              a civil war. American troops and militias become involved in
              the conflict. [2]
 9 Jan 1813 Great Britain declares war on the United States. [1]
12 Jan 1813 William Jones serves as Secretary of the Navy. [3]
13 Jan 1813 John Armstrong replaces William Eustis as Secretary of War. [1]
18 Jan 1813 -22 Jan 1813, Americans are defeated at Frenchtown: After
              defeating a small enemy force at Frenchtown on the River
              Raisin in Michigan Territory on January 18, U.S. forces
              are overwhelmed by an army of British soldiers and warriors
              from indigenous nations four days later. British killed 24,
              wounded 158. Americans killed 975, wounded 27, captured
              648. The following day, indigenous warriors kill somewhere
              between 30 and 100 wounded and abandoned American prisoners
              in an apparent retaliation for actions committed by the
              Americans. "Remember the Raisin!" becomes a popular rallying
              cry for American settlers in the West. [2]

24 Feb 1813 USS Hornet defeats HMS Peacock: While cruising off the coast
              of South America, the U.S. sloop of war Hornet encounters the
              British brig sloop Peacock off the mouth of the Demerara River
              off the coast of Guyana. During the short battle, American
              gunnery shatters the British ship. As the American victors
              transfer the British prisoners to Hornet, Peacock suddenly
              sinks. Nine British and three American sailors drown as a
              result. British killed 14, wounded 33.  Americans killed 4,
              wounded 4. [2]

 1 Jun 1813 HMS Shannon captures USS Chesapeake: [1] [2] [3] As the War
              of 1812 continues, British sea power makes itself felt. The
              Royal Navy blockades many U.S. ports. The frigate Chesapeake
              sails from Boston Harbor on June 1, 1813, to engage HMS
              Shannon. Captain James Lawrence of Chesapeake receives a
              mortal wound early in the battle. Carried below, he issues
              his last order: "Tell the men to fire faster and don't give up
              the ship!" [2] Lawrence died days later. [1] British Marines
              and sailors board the vessel and bloody hand-to-hand combat
              ensues. After 15 minutes, Chesapeake surrenders. British killed
              23, wounded 56.  Americans killed 48, wounded 99. "Don't
              give up the ship!" becomes a powerful rallying cry for the
              U.S. Navy that persists even today. [2]
 3 Jun 1813 Capture of U.S. sloops Growler and Eagle near Ile aux Noix. [3]

              in a British surprise victory at the Battle of Beaver Dams. [5]
24 Jun 1813 Battle of Beaver Dams: [1] [2] [3] Planned as a surprise attack
              on a small British force harassing Fort George, the Battle of
              Beaver Dams results in a serious defeat for the U.S. forces
              in the Niagara campaign of 1813. The American plan is foiled
              by Canadian resident Laura Secord, who makes a heroic 20-mile
              trek through the wilderness at night to warn the British. During
              the afternoon of June 24, a large force of Grand River Iroquois
              ambush the Americans in the forest. Lieutenant Colonel Charles
              Boerstler surrenders the entire American force to the British
              after his troops run low on ammunition. British killed 15,
              wounded 25. Americans killed 50, wounded 525. Months later,
              U.S. forces evacuate Fort George and withdraw to New York. [2]
25 Jun 1813 Burning of Hampton, Virginia. [1]
 5 Jul 1813 Three weeks of British raids on Fort Schlosser, Black Rock and
              Plattsburgh, New York commence. [3]

27 Jul 1813 Battle of Burnt Corn: [2] [3] In present-day Alabama, U.S. forces
              attack "Red Stick" warriors carrying supplies furnished by
              the governor of Spanish-controlled Florida. This marks the
              beginning of America's Creek War. [2]

17 Aug 1813 "Andruss' detachment," composed of militia companies from
              Hunterdon, Middlesex, Sussex, Monmouth and Essex Counties
              (NJ), left the New Jersey militia base at Paulus Hook en route
              to garrison Fort Richmond on Staten Island. The militiamen
              remained on duty there through 25 Sep. The New Jersey militia
              spent the War of 1812 as garrison troops for various coastal
              defense positions. [6]
30 Aug 1813 In retaliation for the U.S. attack at Burnt Corn, Muscogee
              "Red Sticks" assault Fort Mims in present-day Alabama,
              overwhelming the garrison after several hours of bitter
              fighting. Resistance is desperate, as women and boys take
              the place of fallen defenders. Few escape the fort. Native
              Americans killed 100, wounded 200-300.  Americans killed
              250-275. The assault convinces the U.S. to launch a major
              campaign to crush militant Muscogees. [2]
 7 Sep 1813 The United States gets its nickname, Uncle Sam. The name is
              linked to Samuel Wilson, a meat packer from Troy, New York,
              who supplied barrels of beef to the United States Army during
              the War of 1812. Wilson (1766-1854) stamped the barrels with
              "U.S." for United States, but soldiers began referring to the
              grub as "Uncle Sam's." The local newspaper picked up on the
              story and Uncle Sam eventually gained widespread acceptance
              as the nickname for the U.S. federal government. [10]
10 Sep 1813 U.S. naval victory on Lake Erie: "We have met the enemy and they
              are ours ..." So writes Master Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry
              after defeating the British squadron on Lake Erie. [2] [3] [7]
              Following a hard-fought but decisive naval engagement lasting
              three hours, the entire British squadron surrenders. British
              killed 41, wounded 93, captured 306. Americans killed 277,
              wounded 96. The battle secures Lake Erie for the United States
              and allows U.S. commanders to move troops and supplies by
              water, and to regain the initiative in the Old Northwest. [2]
11 Sep 1813 British troops arrive in Mount Vernon and prepare to march to
              and invade Washington, D.C.. [3]

28 Sep 1813 Burlington Races. [3]
 5 Oct 1813 Battle of the Thames: [1] [2] A major victory for the United
              States. Following the U.S. naval victory on Lake Erie, American
              land forces under Major General William Henry Harrison pursue
              retreating British soldiers and warriors from indigenous
              nations. Major General Henry Procter commands the British
              soldiers, and Chief Tecumseh leads the Shawnee, Lenape,
              Ottawa, Ojibwe, Wyandot, Ho-Chunk, Potawatomi, Kickapoo,
              Sauk, Meskwaki, and Muscogee warriors. Harrison's forces,
              led by mounted Kentucky volunteers under Colonel Richard
              M. Johnson, catch the British near Moraviantown, Canada, at the
              Thames River. A mounted charge by the Kentuckians breaks the
              British line. Confused and disordered, most British soldiers
              surrender. After a short, stubborn fight, the warriors
              withdraw. [2] Tecumseh is killed in the battle. [1] [2]
              British and Native Americans killed 45, wounded 30, captured
              600. Americans killed 7, wounded 22. Michigan Territory is
              restored to the United States and Tecumseh's confederacy of
              warriors is shattered. With the United States now ascendant
              in the region, many indigenous nations agree to peace. [2]
 7 Oct 1813 Andrew Jackson establishes camp at Fayetteville, TN to recruit
              American forces to combat the Creeks in Alabama. [1]
26 Oct 1813 A combined force of British regulars, Canadian militia,

11 Nov 1813 Battle of Crysler's Farm: [1] [2] [3] British victory ends
              the U.S. offensive that has targeted Montreal. The Americans
              do not fight badly, but their commander, Brigadier General
              Thomas P. Boyd, sends his soldiers into battle intermittently
              in a seemingly uncoordinated offensive. Major General James
              Wilkinson is too ill to lead the men himself. By late afternoon
              the American army retreats. British and Native Americans killed
              61, wounded 151, missing 13. Americans killed 102, wounded
              237, captured 120. [2] This defeat causes the Americans to
              abandon their Saint Lawrence campaign. [3]

       1814 With Napoleon Bonaparte's defeat in Europe, the British strengthen
              their forces in North America, and for the United States the
              war becomes mainly defensive. The war's bloodiest battles are
              fought in 1814 on the Niagara front. In spite of some defeats,
              U.S. soldiers fight with greater skill and determination. For
              the British, reinforcements from Europe and elsewhere enable
              them to take the offensive by invading upper New York, Coastal
              Maine, the Chesapeake Bay, Cumberland Island in Georgia,
              and the Gulf Coast. [2]
            Hartford Convention-Americans in the Northeast continued their
              significant opposition to the War of 1812. A minority of New
              Englanders called for secession from the Union. Delegates
              from Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island convened
              in Hartford from 15 Dec 1814 to 5 Jan 1815. A number of the
              radical Federalists at the convention called for secession of
              the New England states from the Union. The majority, however,
              voted for a platform demanding a change in the Constitution,
              requiring a two-thirds vote by Congress to impose an embargo,
              admit a western state into the Union or begin a war, except
              in the case of an invasion. [4]

              in the Creek War, U.S. forces under Major General Andrew
              Jackson defeat Muscogee "Red Sticks" at their encampment on a
              bend in the Tallapoosa River in present-day Alabama. [2] [3]
              [5] Intense close combat continues through the night. The "Red
              Sticks" are unwilling to surrender. Native Americans killed 917.
              Americans and allies (Muscogees) killed 70, wounded 206. [2]

25 Jul 1814 Battle of Lundy's Lane: [1] [2] [3] According to British Captain
              John Weeks, "Nothing could resist the obstinate desperation
              of the Yankees." These words sum up the ferocity of the fight
              over the British artillery batteries during the Battle of
              Lundy's Lane. Beginning in the evening, the battle continues
              past midnight. In the darkness, fighting takes place at
              close quarters, with both sides firing muskets and cannon at
              point blank range. Both sides suffer heavy casualties. "Such
              ... carnage I never beheld," a British eyewitness remarks. "Red
              coats, blue and gray were promiscuously intermingled, in many
              places three deep." The Americans withdraw the next day. Many
              regard Lundy's Lane as the hardest fought engagement of the
              war. British killed 84, wounded 559, captured or missing 235.
              Americans killed 173, wounded 571, captured or missing 117. [2]

              4,500 veteran British troops arrive at the Chesapeake Bay. [1]
13 Aug 1814 -17 Sep 1814, Siege of Fort Erie: Following the Battle at
              Lundy's Lane, the U.S. Army withdraws to Fort Erie, which it
              enlarges and strengthens. The British, reinforced, besiege
              the fort. The Americans repulse a British attack on August
              15. On September 17, in a sortie from Fort Erie, Americans
              overrun and spike several British artillery batteries before
              being forced to withdraw. Both sides suffer heavy casualties
              in the exchange. In addition, both sides suffer from the
              nearly constant rain. The British, unable to take the fort,
              withdraw on September 21. British killed 283, wounded 508,
              captured or missing 748. Americans killed 213, wounded 565,
              captured or missing 240. U.S. forces abandon Fort Erie and
              cross into New York in November. [2]

24 Aug 1814 Battle of Bladensburg and capture of Washington City: Landing
              with a force of more than 4,300 soldiers, sailors, and Marines
              near Benedict, Maryland, the British march overland toward
              Washington, DC. A force of poorly trained American militia
              and some regulars try to stop the British at Bladensburg,
              but are routed. Captain Joshua Barney and about 500 seamen
              and Marines do the only real fighting on the American side,
              but they are soon forced to retreat, leaving the road to
              Washington open. The British occupy the city and burn the
              public buildings, including the Capitol and White House. British
              killed 64, wounded 185. Americans killed 10-26, wounded 40-51,
              captured 100-120. This is the low point of the war for the
              United States. [2] The one bright spot in the disaster was
              the quick thinking of First Lady Dolley Madison, who saved a
              portrait of George Washington [2] [10] and other White House
              treasures from the fire. [2]
25 Aug 1814 On the second day of the Burning of Washington, British troops
              torch the Library of Congress, United States Treasury,
              Department of War, and other public buildings. [3]

11 Sep 1814 U.S. naval victory on Lake Champlain: During the first week
              in September, the largest British invasion force assembled
              in Canada begins to march toward Plattsburgh, New York. Its
              objective is to seize territory in upper New York that can be
              used as a bargaining chip in the peace negotiations. However,
              on September 11, the U.S. Navy defeats the British squadron on
              Lake Champlain. Although the British outnumber the Americans on
              land by approximately two to one, the land attack is called off
              because the British commander fears that the U.S. ships might
              ferry troops north and cut off his line of retreat. British
              killed 168, wounded 220, captured 317. Americans killed 104,
              wounded 116. The British retreat from Plattsburgh raises
              American morale and discourages British negotiators at the
              peace talks being held at Ghent, in present-day Belgium. [2]
12 Sep 1814 Battle of North Point; [1] [3] an American detachment halts
              the British land advance to Baltimore. [3] General Robert
              Ross is killed. [1]
            British repulsed at Mobile, Alabama. [3]
            -14 Sep 1814, Battle of Baltimore: After burning Washington,
              DC, the British return to their fleet and proceed up the
              Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore, a large port city dominated by
              pro-war Democratic-Republicans and home to many privateers
              harassing British trade on the high seas. After suffering heavy
              casualties in a victory over American militia at North Point,
              the British proceed to the outskirts of Baltimore but find
              the city too well-defended to attack. They withdraw because
              they cannot get help from the Royal Navy, which is unable to
              compel the surrender of Fort McHenry, located at the mouth
              of Baltimore Harbor, despite a 25-hour bombardment. British
              killed 42-46, wounded 280-296. Americans killed 28, wounded 163,
              captured 50. A young American lawyer named Francis Scott Key
              witnesses the bombardment and pens a stirring poem entitled,
              "The Defence of Fort McHenry." Key suggests the poem can be
              sung to an English drinking tune, "Anacreon in Heaven." [2]
              Key was inspired by the sight of a lone U.S. flag still flying
              over Fort McHenry at daybreak, as reflected in the now-famous
              words of the "Star-Spangled Banner": "And the rocket's red
              glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night
              that our flag was still there." [10] It is soon retitled,
              "The Star-Spangled Banner," and in 1931 Congress names it
              the United States's national anthem. [2]

              and Wyandots, Brigadier General Duncan McArthur conducts a
              deep raid into Upper Canada from Detroit, destroying mills to
              deprive the British army of food. McArthur's force overruns
              a militia force at Malcolm's Mills on November 6. This is
              the only battle during the raid and is the last battle on

              Borgne on Gulf Coast. [2] [3] [5]
15 Dec 1814 Hartford Convention convenes: [2] [3] Dismayed by the course of
              the war and the seemingly destructive policies of the Madison
              administration in Washington, DC, anti-war Federalists in
              New England convene the Hartford Convention to air their
              grievances. Although there is some talk in New England about
              signing a separate peace and pulling out of the Union,
              moderates remain firmly in control at Hartford, and the
              convention proposes a series of constitutional amendments to
              prevent a renewal of the destructive policies and to better
              secure New England's position in the Union. [2]

              present-day Belgium sign a peace treaty Article I provides
              for the war to end when both sides ratify the agreement. Even
              though the British comply on December 27, it takes seven weeks
              for the treaty to reach the United States. In the meantime,
              the war continues. [2] New Jersey militiamen continued to stand
              guard along the state's coastline from Sandy Hook to Delaware
              Bay into the new year of 1815, however, since the United
              States Senate did not ratify the treaty until Feb 1815. [1]
              The Battle of New Orleans was fought the following month. [11]
27 Dec 1814 The American schooner USS Carolina is destroyed. It was the
              last of Commodore Daniel Patterson's makeshift fleet that
              fought a series of delaying actions that contributed to Andrew
              Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans. [3] [5]

 8 Jan 1815 Battle of New Orleans. [1] [2] [3] [5] The war had ended on 24 Dec
              1814 but none of the combatants knew. [5] The British attack
              is the climax of a British campaign on the Gulf Coast. After
              three preliminary engagements fought from 23 Dec 1814 to 1
              Jan 1815, the British launch a major assault against General
              Andrew Jackson's stout defenses south of New Orleans. They are
              repulsed with heavy losses, with over 2,000 killed, wounded,
              missing, or captured, while Jackson's own losses are only
              70. [2] Edward Packenham killed. [1] It is the last major
              battle of the War of 1812 and a resounding American victory. [2]

              Stephen Decatur: [3] After a running duel with HMS Endymion,
              [2] USS President is captured by a squadron of four British
              frigates. [3]
 1 Feb 1815 Construction commences of Pentanguishene Naval Yard. [3]
 4 Feb 1815 United States adopts second enemy trade law. [3]
 8 Feb 1815 -12 Feb 1815, British besiege and capture Fort Bowyer: Following
              the Battle of New Orleans, the British turn their attention
              towards Mobile, then in Mississippi Territory. Fort Bowyer,
              commanded by Major William Lawrence, guards the entrance to
              Mobile Bay. The defending garrison is only 320 strong. On
              February 8, British vessels encircle the fort as 1,400 British
              troops land two and a half miles east, isolating the post.
              Over the next three days, British troops dig trenches to within
              40 yards of the fort's walls. The Americans surrender at noon
              on February 12, 1815. British killed 13, wounded 18. Americans
              killed 1, wounded 10, captured 309. [2]
12 Feb 1815 Surrender of Fort Bowyer. [3]
16 Feb 1815 The United States Senate ratifies the Treaty of Ghent. [1]
17 Feb 1815 U.S. ratifies Treaty of Ghent: [2] [3] The peace treaty reaches
              Washington, DC, on February 14, 1815. The United States Senate
              unanimously approves it two days later, and President James
              Madison completes the ratification process by signing the
              agreement on February 17. This ends the War of 1812. Neither
              Great Britain nor the United States loses any territory
              or surrenders any right. Indigenous nations, however, were
              unable to recover their lost territories and continued to face
              additional loss of land to settlers expanding westward. The
              British make no concessions on the maritime issues that caused
              the war and hold on to Canada. The United States vindicates
              its sovereignty and earns international respect for simply
              having fought the powerful British Empire to a draw. Although
              the war is now officially over, fighting continues on remote
              fronts until the news of peace arrives. [2]
            United States rejects First Bank of the United States'
              proposal. [3]

              [3]
20 Feb 1815 USS Constitution defeats HMS Cyane and HMS Levan, [2] not knowing
              the war is over: [1] In December, 1814, Constitution slips
              out of Boston and evades the British blockading squadron. On
              February 20, off the Madeira Islands, the U.S. warship
              encounters a small Royal Navy frigate and corvette. During
              the night battle that follows, Constitution manages to
              outmaneuver its two opponents, defeating them and forcing
              them to submit. Both ships are manned by American prize
              crews. Although Levant is retaken on March 12 by a pursuing
              British squadron, Cyane reaches a U.S. port as a prize of
              war. British killed 35, wounded 42. Americans killed 4,
              wounded 14. [2]

30 Jun 1815 USS Peacock defeats East India brig Nautilus: The U.S. Navy
              wins the last engagement of the war. Cruising far from
              normal lines of communication, Lewis Warrington, captain
              of the sloop Peacock, does not know the war has ended. Off
              the coast of present-day Indonesia, he fights and captures
              the Honorable East India Company brig Nautilus, even though
              the British officers on the company ship assure him that the
              war is over. British killed 7, wounded 7. Americans wounded
              4. Ironically, the first and the last vessels captured in
              the War of 1812 share the same name. [2]
