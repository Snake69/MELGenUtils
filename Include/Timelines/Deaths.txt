30 Jan 1649 King Charles I of England, who ruled from 1625-1649, was
              beheaded for treason at Banqueting House, Whitehall, by the
              hangman Richard Brandon. He lost his capital trial by one vote,
              68-67. "For the people, and I truly desire their liberty and
              freedom as much as anybody whomsoever, but I must tell you that
              their liberty and their freedom consists in having of government
              those laws by which their life and their goods may be most
              their own. It is not for having a share in government, sirs;
              that is nothing pertaining to them. A subject and a sovereign are
              clean different things." Charles I was canonized by the church
              of England 13 years later. Parliament became the supreme power
              under the rule of Oliver Cromwell, who ruled over Parliament as
              Lord Protector of the New Commonwealth from 1649-1658. He argued
              against his soldiers having a voice in government because they
              owned no property. He stated in so many words that government
              "has always been, and should always continue to be of property,
              by property and for property." [7] After Cromwell's victory over
              Charles I he took his New Model army to Dublin to subdue the
              Irish who had supported the royalist. During Cromwells sojourn
              in Ireland which lasted for one year, he engaged in a general
              massacre of Royalist. In Oct 1651 the last Royalist stronghold -
              Limerick - was captured by Cromwell's supporters. To pay his
              officers Cromwell passed an Act of Settlement which gave his
              supporters large tracts of land in Ireland, spurring Protestant
              settlement in Northern Ireland. [13]

 3 Feb 1780 In one of the most famous crimes of post-Revolution America,
              Barnett Davenport commits an awful mass murder in rural
              Connecticut. Caleb Mallory, his wife, daughter-in-law, and
              two grandchildren were killed in their home by their boarder,
              Davenport. Davenport, born in 1760, enlisted in the American
              army as a teenager and had served at Valley Forge and Fort
              Ticonderoga. In the waning days of the war with the British,
              he came to live in the Mallory household. Today, Davenport's
              crime might be ascribed to some type of post-war stress
              syndrome, but at the time it was the source of a different
              sociological significance. Apparently unprovoked, Davenport beat
              Caleb Mallory to death. He then beat Mallory's seven-year-old
              grandchild with a rifle and killed his daughter-in-law. Davenport
              looted the home before setting it on fire, killing two others.
              His shocking confession was the basis of much soul-searching
              for the fledgling nation's press. Many books were written about
              the crime, and the perception of murderers began to change in
              America. Until then, crime was most often seen as the result of
              common sinners losing their way. But Davenport's crime and its
              portrayal to the public caused people to perceive criminals
              as evil and alien to the rest of society. To some degree,
              this view has persisted through the years. [5]

15 Nov 1832 Jean-Baptiste Say (b.1767), French economist, died. [7] [8] He
              is remembered for what came to be called Say's Law: "the supply
              (sale) of X creates the demand (purchase) of Y." This law can
              be shown by business-cycle statistics. When downturns start,
              production is always first to decline, ahead of demand. When
              the economy recovers, production recovers ahead of demand. A
              society can't consume if it does not produce. [7]

 6 Mar 1836 The Alamo fell after fighting for 13 days. Angered by a new
              Mexican constitution that removed much of their autonomy, Texans
              seized the Alamo in San Antonio in Dec 1835. Mexican president
              General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna marched into Texas to put
              down the rebellion. By late Feb 1836, 182 Texans, led by Colonel
              William Travis, held the former mission complex against Santa
              Anna's 6,000 troops. At 4 a.m., after fighting for 13 days,
              Santa Anna's troops charged. In the battle that followed,
              all the Alamo defenders were killed (including William Travis,
              Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett) while the Mexicans suffered about
              2,000 casualties. Santa Anna dismissed the Alamo conquest as
              "a small affair," but the time bought by the Alamo defenders'
              lives permitted General Sam Houston to forge an army that
              would win the Battle of San Jacinto and, ultimately, Texas'
              independence. Mexican Lt. Col. Pena later wrote a memoir:
              "With Santa Anna in Texas: Diary of Jose Enrique de la Pena,"
              that described the capture and execution of Davy Crockett and
              6 other Alamo defenders. In 1975 a translation of the diary
              by Carmen Perry (d.1999) was published. Apparently, only one
              Texan combatant survived Jose Maria Guerrero, who persuaded
              his captors he had been forced to fight. Women, children,
              and a black slave, were spared. [7]
            Texas Revolution: Battle of the Alamo - After a thirteen-day
              siege by an army of 3,000 Mexican troops, the 187 Texas
              volunteers, including frontiersman Davy Crockett and colonel
              Jim Bowie, defending the Alamo are killed and the fort is
              captured. [8]
27 Mar 1836 Mexican Colonel Jose Nicolas de la Portilla executed his Texan
              prisoners at Goliad. Colonel Portilla had the 342 Texians
              marched out of Fort Defiance into three columns. The Texians
              were then fired on at point-blank range. The wounded and dying
              were then clubbed and stabbed. Those who survived the initial
              volley were run down by the Mexican cavalry. [7]

              "Aereon," airship, consisting of two hydrogen filled airbags and
              a rudder which, unlike conventional balloons of the era, could
              actually be navigated through the air. He flew it on several
              occasions, over Perth Amboy and New York City in the 1860s,
              and even offered it to the government during the Civil War,

29 Nov 1872 Horace Greeley (b.1811), founder of the New York Tribune,
              died. The daily paper reflected much of the morality of his New
              England upbringing and he partnered a high standard of news
              gathering with printed arguments and urges against drinking,
              gambling, capital punishment and - increasingly in the 1850s -
              slavery. The slavery issue and his lifelong desire for high
              political office led him away from his political party, the
              Whigs, and to the newly emerging Republican Party. He usually
              sided with the radical wing of the Republicans, advocating
              early emancipation of slaves. Still unsuccessful in state
              and national bids, he eventually joined a group of Republican
              dissenters who formed the Liberal Republican Party to oppose
              Grant. While he received almost 44% of the popular vote, he
              received only 18% of the electoral vote, which were cast for
              other candidates due to his death. [7]
