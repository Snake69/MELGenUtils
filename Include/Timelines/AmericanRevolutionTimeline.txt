       1759 -1768, New England Planters immigrate to Nova Scotia, Canada
              to take up lands left vacant after the Expulsion of the
              Acadians. [2]
 8 Sep 1760 Pierre de Rigaud, Governor of New France, capitulates to Field
              Marshal Jeffrey Amherst. This ends most fighting in North
              America between France and Great Britain in the French and
              Indian War. Amherst becomes the First British Governor-General
              of territories that would later become Canada plus lands (Ohio
              Country and Illinois Country) west of the American Colonies. [2]
25 Oct 1760 King George II of Great Britain dies and is succeeded by his
              grandson George III. [2] George III tried to rule both England
              and the colonies without any attention to the wishes of the
              people. His obstinacy and narrow-mindedness helped to drive
              the colonies into revolt, and secured for them the sympathy
              of many leading Whigs in England. [3]
       1761 The Navigation Laws of 1651 and 1660, which had been unenforced,
              were now revived. Warships were placed along the coast to stop
              the trade which had grown up with France, Spain, and their
              West Indian colonies. [3]
            The "Writs of Assistance" were issued as a means of assistance
              in the enforcement of the navigation acts. They caused bitter
              dissatisfaction in New England, which had become the centre
              for smuggling. These Writs of Assistance were general search
              warrants given to customs officials in which they themselves
              could enter the name of any person suspected of concealing
              smuggled goods, which were not described, and they, therefore,
              could break into and search any house at any time. [3]
            James Otis, the leading lawyer of Massachusetts, made a
              celebrated speech in Boston denying the right of the English
              government to issue Writs of Assistance, or even to pass an act
              of trade which levied a tax on the colonies. Of this speech
              John Adams said: "It breathed into this nation the breath of
              life." [3]
       1763 -1766 Pontiac's Rebellion; previously allied with France,
              Native American tribes in the Great Lakes region resist the
              policies of the British under Amherst. [2]
            Patrick Henry appeared in the "Parsons' Cause," and vindicated
              the right of the colonies to manage their own affairs. The
              scarcity of the tobacco crop had caused a law to be passed in
              Virginia, in 1755 and again in 1758, which fixed the price of
              tobacco at two pence per pound. These laws fell heavily on the
              parsons, whose salary was paid in tobacco; with the price of
              tobacco low, they would, therefore, get little money. They
              appealed to England against the laws of 1755 and 1758, and
              the King upheld their plea. Patrick Henry opposed the Crown,
              asserting that "by annuling or disallowing acts of so salutary
              a nature, from being the father of his people (the King)
              degenerates into a tyrant, and forfeits all rights to his
              subjects' obedience." [5]
10 Feb 1763 Signing of the Treaty of Paris ending the Seven Year's War,
              also known as the French and Indian War in North America.
              France ceded all mainland North American territories, except New
              Orleans, in order to retain her Caribbean sugar islands. Britain
              gained all territory east of the Mississippi River; Spain kept
              territory west of the Mississippi, but exchanged East and West
              Florida for Cuba. [1]
 7 Oct 1763 Proclamation of 1763; wary of the cost of defending the colonies,
              George III prohibited all settlement west of the Appalachian
              mountains without guarantees of security from local Native
              American nations. The intervention in colonial affairs offended
              the thirteen colonies' claim to the exclusive right to govern
              lands to their west. [1]
 5 Apr 1764 Sugar Act; the first attempt to finance the defense of the
              colonies by the British Government. In order to deter smuggling
              and to encourage the production of British rum, taxes on
              molasses were dropped; a levy was placed on foreign Madeira
              wine and colonial exports of iron, lumber and other goods had
              to pass first through Britain and British customs. The Act
              established a Vice-Admiralty Court in Halifax, Nova Scotia to
              hear smuggling cases without jury and with the presumption of
              guilt. These measures led to widespread protest. [1]
 1 Sep 1764 The Currency Act [5] prohibited American colonies from issuing
              their own currency, angering many American colonists. [4]
       1764 Beginnings of Colonial Opposition. American colonists responded
              to the Sugar Act and the Currency Act with protest. In
              Massachusetts, participants in a town meeting cried out
              against taxation without proper representation in Parliament,
              and suggested some form of united protest throughout the
              colonies. By the end of the year, many colonies were practicing
              nonimportation, a refusal to use imported English goods. [4]
            King George III, and his friends in Parliament, demanded that
              the American Colonies pay a share of the English debt incurred
              during the French and Indian War. [3]
       1765 Organized Colonial Protest. American colonists responded to
              Parliament's acts with organized protest. Throughout the
              colonies, a network of secret organizations known as the
              Sons of Liberty was created, aimed at intimidating the stamp
              agents who collected Parliament's taxes. Before the Stamp Act
              could even take effect, all the appointed stamp agents in the
              colonies had resigned. The Massachusetts Assembly suggested
              a meeting of all the colonies to work for the repeal of the
              Stamp Act. All but four colonies were represented. The Stamp
              Act Congress passed a "Declaration of Rights and Grievances,"
              which claimed that American colonists were equal to all other
              British citizens, protested taxation without representation,
              and stated that, without colonial representation in Parliament,
              Parliament could not tax colonists. In addition, the colonists
              increased their nonimportation efforts. [6]
22 Mar 1765 Stamp Act; seeking to defray some of the costs of garrisoning the
              colonies, Parliament required all legal documents, newspapers
              and pamphlets required to use watermarked, or 'stamped' paper
              on which a levy was placed. [1] The Stamp Act was Parliament's
              first direct tax on the American colonies. [2] [4] [6]
24 Mar 1765 Parliament enacts the Quartering Act, requiring the Colonies
              to provide housing, food, and other provisions to British
              troops. The act is resisted or circumvented in most of the
              colonies. In 1767 and again in 1769, Parliament suspended the
              governor and legislature of New York for failure to comply. [2]
15 May 1765 Quartering Act; Colonial assemblies required to pay for
              supplies to British garrisons. The New York assembly argued
              that it could not be forced to comply. [1]
29 May 1765 Patrick Henry introduced a resolution in the Virginia Assembly
              denying the right of Parliament to legislate on the internal
              concerns of Virginia. [3] "If this be treason, make the most
              of it." - Patrick Henry, Virginia Convention. [4]
30 May 1765 Virginian Resolution; the Virginian assembly refused to comply
              with the Stamp Act. [1]
 5 Jun 1765 Several hundred Woodbridge (NJ) "Sons of Liberty" gathered at
              "the Liberty Oak, on the square" to celebrate the repeal of
              the Stamp Act. [7]
14 Aug 1765 Massachusetts colonists challenge British rule by an Elm
              (Liberty Tree) [9]
25 Aug 1765 In protest over the stamp tax, American colonists sacked and
              burned the home of Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson. In
              1774 he was exiled to Britain. [10]
 7 Oct 1765 -25 Oct 1765; Stamp Act Congress; representatives from nine of
              the thirteen colonies declare the Stamp Act unconstitutional
              as it was a tax levied without their consent. [1] The Stamp
              Act Congress was the first independent colonial conference
              and convened in New York in response to a call from the
              Massachusetts House of Representatives. [4]
19 Oct 1765 A Declaration of Rights and Grievances adopted; petitions
              Parliament and the king to repeal the Stamp Act. [2]
 1 Nov 1765 the stamp act goes into effect in the British colonies; colonists
              reacted strongly with flags at half mast and burning of stamps
              [8]
23 Nov 1765 Fredrick County, Maryland repudiated the British Stamp Act [8]
11 Feb 1766 Stamp Act declared unconstitutional in Virginia [9]
19 Feb 1766 1,000 armed "sons of Liberty" in Brunswick Town, North Carolina
              confront Royal Governor William Tryon in resistance of the
              Stamp Act. [4]
26 Feb 1766 The Woodbridge (NJ) "Sons of Liberty" passed a resolution
              condemning the Stamp Act as "unconstitutional," while still
              expressing loyalty to King George III. [7]
18 Mar 1766 Declaratory Act; Parliament finalises the repeal of the Stamp
              Act, [1] [2] [19] but declares that it has the right to tax
              colonies.  [1] Some in Parliament thought the army should be
              used to enforce the Stamp Act, others commended the colonists
              for resisting a tax passed by a legislative body in which they
              were not represented. After act was repealed, the colonies
              abandoned their ban on imported British goods. The repeal of
              the Stamp Act did not mean that Great Britain was surrendering
              any control over its colonies. The Declaratory Act stated
              that Parliament could make laws binding the American colonies
              "in all cases whatsoever." [6]
21 May 1766 Liberty Pole erected in New York City commons in celebration
              of the Stamp Act repeal. An intermittent skirmish with the
              British garrison over the removal of this and other poles,
              and their replacement by the Sons of Liberty, rages until the
              Province of New York is under the control of the revolutionary
              New York Provincial Congress in 1775. [2]
27 Jul 1766 Following a dispute over reimbursement for their expenses
              in Elizabethtown (NJ), officers of the British Twenty-eighth
              Regiment rioted, leading some of their men to break open the
              local jail and free prisoners and cause other property damage,
              before marching to Amboy and the troop transports they were
              leaving New Jersey on. The commander at Amboy ordered them
              off the ships and made them apologize and pay compensation
              for property damages, but the incident left local people with
              considerable resentment towards redcoats. [7]
       1766 Resistance to the Quartering Act in New York. New York served as
              headquarters for British troops in America, so the Quartering
              Act had a great impact on New York City. When the New York
              Assembly refused to assist in quartering troops, a skirmish
              occurred in which one colonist was wounded. Parliament suspended
              the Assembly's powers but never carried out the suspension,
              since the Assembly soon agreed to contribute money toward the
              quartering of troops. [6]
29 Jun 1767 Townshend Revenue Act (Townshend Duties); duties on tea, glass,
              lead, paper and paint to help pay for the administration of
              the colonies, named after Charles Townshend, the Chancellor
              of the Exchequer. John Dickinson publishes Letter from a
              Philadelphian Farmer in protest. Colonial assemblies condemn
              taxation without representation. [1]
       1767 In response to new taxes, the colonies again decided to
              discourage the purchase of British imports. [6]
            "Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to the Inhabitants of
              the British Colonies." Originally published in a newspaper,
              this widely reproduced pamphlet by John Dickinson declared that
              Parliament could not tax the colonies, called the Townshend
              Acts unconstitutional, and denounced the suspension of the
              New York Assembly as a threat to colonial liberties. [6]
            Parliament temporarily deprived New York of its legislative
              rights because the New York Legislature had refused to supply
              quarters for British troops. [3]
       1768 Samuel Adams wrote a statement (Massachusetts Circular Letter),
              approved by the Massachusetts House of Representatives, which
              attacked Parliament's persistence in taxing the colonies without
              proper representation, and which called for unified resistance
              by all the colonies. Many colonies issued similar statements. In
              response, the British governor of Massachusetts dissolved the
              state's legislature. British Troops Arrive in Boston. Although
              the Sons of Liberty threatened armed resistance to arriving
              British troops, none was offered when the troops stationed
              themselves in Boston. [6]
   Apr 1768 Britain's Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Hillsborough,
              orders colonial governors to stop their own assemblies from
              endorsing Adams' circular letter. Hillsborough also orders
              the governor of Massachusetts to dissolve the general court
              if the Massachusetts assembly does not revoke the letter. By
              month's end, the assemblies of New Hampshire, Connecticut and
              New Jersey have endorsed the letter. [2]
 9 Apr 1768 John Hancock refuses to allow two British customs agents to go
              below deck of his ship, considered by some to be the first act
              of physical resistance to British authority in the colonies [9]
   May 1768 A British warship armed with 50 cannons sails into Boston
              harbor after a call for help from custom commissioners who
              are constantly being harassed by Boston agitators. In June,
              a customs official is locked up in the cabin of the Liberty,
              a sloop owned by John Hancock. Imported wine is then unloaded
              illegally into Boston without payment of duties. Following
              this incident, customs officials seize Hancock's sloop. After
              threats of violence from Bostonians, the customs officials
              escape to an island off Boston, then request the intervention
              of British troops. [2]
10 Jun 1768 British customs officials seize John Hancock's ship, "The
              Liberty", on the suspicion that Hancock had illegally unloaded
              cargo without paying [9]
   Jul 1768 The governor of Massachusetts dissolves the general court after
              the legislature defies his order to revoke Adams' circular
              letter. In August, in Boston and New York, merchants agree
              to boycott most British goods until the Townshend Acts are
              repealed. In September, at a town meeting in Boston, residents
              are urged to arm themselves. Later in September, English warships
              sail into Boston Harbor, then two regiments of English infantry
              land in Boston and set up permanent residence to keep order. [2]
18 Jul 1768 Boston Gazette publishes "Liberty Song", America's 1st patriotic
              song [9]
 1 Aug 1768 Boston Non-Importation Agreement [5]
 1 Oct 1768 British troops arrive in Boston in response to political unrest
              [1] and to enforce the Townshend duties (taxes on paint,
              paper, tea, etc., passed in Jun 1767) and clamp down on local
              radicals. The troops' presence doesn't sit well with locals
              and leads to street fights. [13]
       1769 The Virginia House of Burgesses passed resolutions condemning
              Britain's actions against Massachusetts, and stating that only
              Virginia's governor and legislature could tax its citizens. The
              members also drafted a formal letter to the King, completing
              it just before the legislature was dissolved by Virginia's
              royal governor. [6]
            Lord North repealed all the taxes except that on tea, which was
              retained for principle's sake. English merchants, suffering from
              the "Non-importation Agreements," had petitioned parliament
              to repeal the taxes, but the retention of the tea tax caused
              the conciliatory effect to be lost. [3]
17 May 1769 Washington criticizes "taxation without representation" [12]
       1770 Because of the reduced profits resulting from the colonial
              boycott of imported British goods, Parliament withdrew all of
              the Townshend Act (1767) taxes except for the tax on tea. [6]
            In response to Parliament's relaxation of its taxation laws,
              the colonies relaxed their boycott of British imported goods
              (1767). [6]
            Conflict between Citizens and British Troops in New York. After
              a leading New York Son of Liberty issued a broadside attacking
              the New York Assembly for complying with the Quartering Act
              (1765), a riot erupted between citizens and soldiers, resulting
              in serious wounds but no fatalities. [6]
19 Jan 1770 Golden Hill (Lower Manhattan) incident in which British troops
              wound civilians, including one death. [2]
28 Jan 1770 Lord North becomes Prime Minister of Great Britain. [2]
 5 Mar 1770 Boston Massacre. The arrival of troops in Boston provoked
              conflict between citizens and soldiers. A group of soldiers
              surrounded by an unfriendly crowd opened fire, killing
              three Americans [6] (including Crispus Attucks, American
              slave, b. 1723) [2] and fatally wounding two more. A violent
              uprising was avoided only with the withdrawal of the troops
              to islands in the harbor. The soldiers were tried for murder,
              but convicted only of lesser crimes; noted patriot John Adams
              was their principal lawyer. [6] While radicals will call it
              the Boston Massacre, the British will call it the incident
              on King Street. [13] This event that would contribute to the
              outbreak of the American Revolutionary War (also known as the
              American War of Independence) five years later. [2]
12 Apr 1770 Repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act [1]
16 May 1771 Battle of Alamance, North Carolina, [2] [4] (present-day
              Alamance County) [2] the first battle fought against
              Britain. Eleven hundred North Carolina Royal Militiamen defeat
              two thousand Regulators [4] (rebels), [2] ending the War of
              the Regulation. [4]
       1772 The Watauga Association in what would become Tennessee declares
              itself independent. [2]
 9 Jun 1772 Gaspee Affair. [2] Attack on the "Gaspee." After [6] eight [16]
              boatloads of men [6] led by merchant John Brown [16] attacked a
              grounded British customs schooner near Providence, Rhode Island,
              the royal governor offered a reward for the discovery of the men,
              planning to send them to England for trial. The removal of the
              "Gaspee" trial to England outraged American colonists. [6] The
              "Gaspee" was burned.  None of the perpetrators were discovered
              by the British. [16]
 2 Nov 1772 Boston: anti-English Committee of Correspondence forms.
              [9] Samuel Adams called for a Boston town meeting to create
              committees of correspondence to communicate Boston's position
              to the other colonies. Similar committees were soon created
              throughout the colonies. [6] This represents an important move
              toward cooperation, mutual action, and the development of a
              national identity among Americans. [13]
       1773 As a result of the Gaspee incident, the Virginia House of
              Burgesses appointed a Committee of Correspondence to keep in
              touch with other colonies. Other Colonial Legislatures soon
              made provision for committees of the same sort. [3]
10 May 1773 Tea Act; in an effort to support the ailing East India Company,
              Parliament exempted its tea from import duties and allowed the
              Company to sell its tea directly to the colonies. Americans
              resented what they saw as an indirect tax subsidising a British

16 Dec 1773 Boston Tea Party. [2] [6] When British tea ships arrived
              in Boston harbor, many citizens wanted the tea sent back to
              England without the payment of any taxes. The royal governor
              insisted on payment of all taxes. A group of men [6] (members
              of the Sons of Liberty) [2] disguised as Mohawk Indians [2] [6]
              (led by Samuel Adams) boarded the ships and dumped all the tea
              (342 chests) in the harbor. [6]

            Lord Dunmore's War [2]
            New England Prepares for War. British troops began to fortify
              Boston, and seized ammunition belonging to the colony of
              Massachusetts. Thousands of American militiamen were ready
              to resist, but no fighting occurred. Massachusetts created
              a Provincial Congress, and a special Committee of Safety to
              decide when the militia should be called into action. Special
              groups of militia, known as Minute Men, were organized to be
              ready for instant action. [6]
 5 Mar 1774 John Hancock delivers the fourth annual Massacre Day oration,
              a commemoration of the Boston Massacre, and denounces the

28 Mar 1774 British Parliament adopts the Coercive Acts [12] (also called
              the Intolerable Acts). [13] In response to the Boston Tea Party,
              Parliament passed several acts to punish Massachusetts. The
              Boston Port Bill banned the loading or unloading of any ships
              in Boston harbor. The Administration of Justice Act offered
              protection to royal officials in Massachusetts, allowing them
              to transfer to England all court cases against them involving
              riot suppression or revenue collection. The Massachusetts
              Government Act put the election of most government officials
              under the control of the Crown, essentially eliminating the
              Massachusetts charter of government. [6]
31 Mar 1774 Boston Port Act, one of the "Intolerable Acts". [5] The Kingdom

 5 Sep 1774 To protest Britain's actions, Massachusetts suggested a return
              to nonimportation, but several states preferred a congress of
              all the colonies to discuss united resistance. The colonies
              soon named delegates to a congress - the First Continental
              Congress - met in Philadelphia [6] through 26 Oct 1774. [16]
              The Congress sat in Carpenters Hall. They affirmed the right of
              the colonies to life, liberty and property. Fifty-six delegates
              attended, half of whom were lawyers. [16]
            Twelve of the thirteen colonies sent a total of fifty-six
              delegates to the First Continental Congress. Only Georgia was
              not represented. One accomplishment of the Congress was the
              Association of 1774, which urged all colonists to avoid using
              British goods, and to form committees to enforce this ban. [6]

              ship by a captain afraid of docking at Philadelphia was burned
              by around forty protestors dressed as Indians. The Cumberland
              County Historical Society erected a monument to the incident
              at Market Square in Greenwich in 1908. [7]
       1775 New England Restraining Act. Parliament passed an act banning
              trade between the New England colonies and any other country
              besides Great Britain. [6]

              colonial ammunition, but were turned back in Massachusetts,
              without any violence. Royal authorities decided that force
              should be used to enforce recent acts of Parliament; war seemed
              unavoidable. [6]

19 Apr 1775 British troops planned to destroy American ammunition at
              Concord. When the Boston Committee of Safety learned of
              this plan, it sent Paul Revere and William Dawes to alert
              the countryside and gather the Minute Men. Minute Men and
              British troops met at Lexington, where a shot from a stray
              British gun (shot "heard round the world") lead to more British
              firing. The Americans only fired a few shots; several Americans
              were killed. The British marched on to Concord and destroyed
              some ammunition, but soon found the countryside swarming
              with militia. At the end of the day, many were dead on both
              sides. [6] American militiamen fought 700 British troops. The
              battle broke out at Concord. Seventy-three British soldiers
              were killed, and over two hundred were wounded. The Americans
              lost 49 soldiers and suffered 39 wounded. This marked the true
              beginning of the Revolutionary War. [16]

 5 May 1775 Benjamin Franklin arrived in Philadelphia from London where
              he had lived since 1764. He soon began working with Thomas

10 Jun 1775 John Adams proposed that Congress consider the forces in Boston
              a Continental army, and suggested the need for a general. He
              recommended George Washington for the position. Congress began
              to raise men from other colonies to join the army in New England,
              and named a committee to draft military rules. [6]

              and stated that any person helping the Americans would
              be considered a traitor and rebel. [6] The British offer a
              pardon to all colonists who lay down their arms. There would
              be only two exceptions to the amnesty: Samuel Adams and John
              Hancock, if captured, were to be hanged. [2] When Americans
              began to fortify a hill (Bunker Hill) against British forces,
              British ships in the harbor discovered the activity and opened
              fire. British troops -- 2,400 in number -- arrived shortly
              after. Although the Americans -- 1,000 in number -- resisted
              several attacks, eventually they lost the fortification. [6]

              but to attack the Americans. On the afternoon of the 17th,
              Gage's forces attacked. In a hard fought battle, the American
              were forced to withdraw. While the British were victorious,
              they suffered heavy losses. [16]
16 Jun 1775 Washington accepted the nomination to lead the army. To pay
              for the army, Congress issued bills of credit, and the twelve
              colonies represented in the Congress promised to share in
              repaying the bills. [6]
17 Jun 1775 The Battle of Bunker Hill was actually fought [10] [20] on
              Breed's Hill near Boston. It lasted less than 2 hours and was
              the deadliest of the Revolutionary War. The British captured the
              hill on their third attempt but suffered over 1,000 casualties
              vs. about 400-600 for the Americans. Patriotic hero Dr. Joseph
              Warren died in the battle. Patriot General William Prescott
              allegedly told his men, "Don't one of you fire until you see
              the whites of their eyes!" British casualties were estimated
              at 226 dead and 828 wounded, while American casualties were

              authorized privateering, and issued rules for dealing with
              enemy vessels and plunder. [6]

              complete independence. The first 1,000 sold within days at
              2 shillings. By the end of the year some 150,000 copies were
              sold, greatly affecting public sentiment and the deliberations
              of the Continental Congress leading up to the Declaration of
              Independence. An instant bestseller in both the colonies and in
              Britain, Paine boldly stated that King George III was a tyrant
              and that Americans should shed any sentimental attachment to
              the monarchy. America, he argued, had a moral obligation to
              reject monarchy. [10]

            Word of the United States Declaration of Independence reaches

12 Aug 1776 General George Washington writes to Major General Charles Lee
              that the Continental Army's situation had deteriorated due to
              an outbreak of smallpox and problems with desertion. Washington
              feared that the superior British navy might blockade New York,
              thus isolating the city from communications with other states.
              Washington was correct that the British intended to capture
              New York City and gain control of the Hudson River, a victory
              that would divide the rebellious colonies in half. British
              General William Howe's large army landed on Long Island,
              however, 10 days later than they had planned, on 22 Aug.
              Finally, on 27 Aug, the Redcoats marched against the Patriot
              position at Brooklyn Heights, overcoming the Americans at
              Gowanus Pass and then outflanking the entire Continental
              Army. The Americans suffered 1,000 casualties to the British
              loss of only 400 men during the fighting. After the victory,
              Howe chose not to follow the advice of his subordinates and
              did not storm the Patriot redoubts at Brooklyn Heights, where
              he could have taken the Patriots' military leadership prisoner
              and ended the rebellion. General Washington ordered a retreat
              to Manhattan by boat. The British could easily have prevented
              this retreat and captured most of the Patriot officer corps,
              including Washington. General William Howe and his brother,
              Admiral Richard Howe, however, still hoped to convince the
              Americans to rejoin the British empire in the wake of the
              humiliating defeat, instead of forcing the former colonies
              into submission after executing Washington and his officers
              as traitors. Indeed, on 11 Sep, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams
              and other congressional representatives reopened negotiations
              with the Howe brothers on Staten Island; the negotiations fell
              through when the British refused to accept American independence.
              The British captured New York City on 15 Sep; it would remain
              in British hands until the end of the war. [12]
            Andrew Pickens' detachment surrounded by 185 Cherokee Indians,

              Fight." Col. Williamson and Andrew Pickens defeat Cherokee
              Indians and burn Tamassy, an Indian town. [5]

              General George Washington at the Battle of Brooklyn Heights in
              New York. [2] [12] The Americans suffered 1,000 casualties to
              the British loss of only 400 men during the fighting. After the
              victory, Howe chose not to follow the advice of his subordinates
              and did not storm the Patriot redoubts at Brooklyn Heights,
              where he could have taken the Patriots' military leadership
              prisoner and ended the rebellion. [12]

16 Sep 1776 Despite the American failure to stop the British invasion of
              New York City the previous day at Kip's Bay, the successful [12]
              Battle of Harlem Heights [2] [12] restored public confidence in the
              American troops and lifted the spirits of the Continental
              Army. The Americans and British each lost approximately 70
              troops in the fighting. One of the Americans lost was the
              Ranger leader, Captain Thomas Knowlton. [12]

              of them prisoners, on Rall's Hessians, and mortally wounded the
              colonel himself in a victory that saved the Revolution. Despite
              legend, folklore and British blame-shifting, the Hessians were
              not drunk as a result of a Christmas celebration, but were
              in a precarious tactical position and caught by surprise by
              Washington's daring maneuvers and impeccable leadership. [7]

              train in Somerset County, in the beginning stages of what came

              Maxwell was happy to accommodate the colonel's apparent desire
              for a fight. Mawhood tried to outflank a line of militiamen
              with a company of grenadiers from the Forty-second Highland
              Regiment, but Scotch Willie had hidden some of his Jerseymen
              in a position outflanking the advance, and they rose and shot
              the regulars to ribbons. [7]

 1 Jul 1777 British forces approached Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain. The
              fort was commanded by General Schuyler. After putting up a
              token defense, Schuyler moved his forces to Fort Edward on
              the Hudson. British forces, under the command of General
              Burgoyne, advanced slowly on Fort Edwards, arriving after
              three weeks, and captured the fort. Remaining at the fort
              for almost another month, Burgoyne sent 800 of his men to
              Vermont to obtain supplies. These troops were defeated by
              local militia. With autumn approaching, Burgoyne knew that he
              had to reach Albany. American forces, now under the command
              of General Gates, fortified themselves along the way. A final
              battle was fought at Freeman's farm, where the Americans were
              victorious once again. Burgoyne withdrew to fortified positions
              at Saratoga. When it became clear to Burgoyne that there would be
              no relief force from the South, he surrendered his troops to the

              becomes known as the Paoli Massacre. Not wanting to lose the
              element of surprise, Grey ordered his troops to empty their

              the British planning a surprise attack on Washington's army
              for the following day. Using a cover story that she needed to
              buy flour from a nearby mill just outside the British line,

              Thomas Craig the following day. [12]

              Penn. Gen. Howe refrained from a direct attack on Whitemarsh,
              where Gen. Wasinington was based, and the battle dissolved in
              a series of inconclusive skirmishes that lasted 3 days. The

              Henry Clinton's British army, which was withdrawing from
              Philadelphia to New York, [7] ended in a tactical draw, [2]
              [7] but was an American moral victory, as the Continental army
              stood up to the best of the British and held the field at the
              end of the day. [7] The British withdraw from Monmouth Court
              House under cover of darkness. [2] In addition, "Molly Pitcher"

              Hackensack River crossing, quartering them at Overkill (today's
              River Vale) in local homes. In a 650-man night bayonet attack
              forever after known locally as the "Baylor Massacre," the
              British overran the dragoons, who had unaccountably neglected
              to post sentries in all directions. Casualty accounts vary,
              but the Americans apparently lost 15 men killed and 54 wounded
              and captured. Several survivors subsequently died of wounds. [7]

              deserted from the British) deserted from the Legion and informed
              Ferguson, who was still in the area, of the unit's location

              attack on 15 Oct, killing between thirty and fifty men. [7]

              Regiment stationed at Hackensack, wrote to General George
              Washington that "My Regiment is hardly sufficient to keep
              necessary Guards for our own Security, which renders it very
              severe Duty to keep a Guard at the Liberty Pole and parties
              out to intercept the Villains that are dayly carrying Supplies
              to the Enemy." [7]

              have not a ton of hay at command, nor magazine [supply point]
              to draw from. Money is extremely scarce, and worth little
              when we get it. We have been so poor in camp for a fortnight,
              (two weeks) that we could not forward the public dispatches,
              for want of cash to support the expresses." [7]
14 Mar 1780 Bombardment of Fort Charlotte: After a two-week siege, Spanish
              general, colonial governor of Louisiana, and Viceroy of New
              Spain Bernardo de Galvez captures Fort Charlotte, taking the
              port of Mobile (in present-day Alabama) from the British. Fort
              Charlotte was the last remaining British frontier post capable
              of threatening New Orleans in Spanish Louisiana. Its fall drove
              the British from the western reaches of West Florida and reduced
              the British military presence in West Florida to its capital,
              Pensacola. [2]

              on Sullivan's Island to occupy Charleston Harbor. Washington will
              order reinforcements to Charleston, but the city falls on May
              12 in what is arguably the worst American defeat of the war. [2]
19 Apr 1780 General George Washington welcomed distinguished visitors
              "the Chevalier de la Luzerne, Minister of France, with another
              French gentleman, and Don Juan de Miralles, a gentleman of
              distinction from Spain," to the Ford Mansion, his Morristown

24 Apr 1780 General George Washington put on a show for his distinguished
              French visitor, the Chevalier de la Luzerne: "... a field of
              parade being prepared under the direction of the Baron Steuben,
              four battalions of our army were presented for review, by the
              French minister, attended by his Excellency and our general
              officers. Thirteen cannon, as usual, announced their arrival in
              the field, and they received from the officers and soldiers the
              military honors due to their military rank. In the evening,
              General Washington and the French minister attended a ball
              provided by our principal officers, at which were present a
              numerous collection of ladies and gentlemen of distinguished
              character." [7]
29 Apr 1780 General George Washington's Morristown (NJ) guest, the
              Spanish diplomat Don Juan de Miralles, who had fallen ill with
              "a violent biliary complaint" died, and was "inter'd ... at
              Morris Town." A funeral procession proceeded from Washington's
              headquarters at the Ford mansion to the cemetery. [7]
 2 May 1780 Congress issues "Instructions to Privateers" [14]
 6 May 1780 Siege of Charleston: Fort Moultrie falls to the British. [2]
12 May 1780 The British take Charleston, SC, capture a large patriot army,
              and deal the rebels one of their worst defeats of the war.
              The British lose 255 men. The Americans were lead by General
              Benjamin Lincoln. The Charleston move is part of a broader
              British strategy to hang on to the southern colonies, at least,
              now that the war is stalemated in Pennsylvania and New York. [13]
21 May 1780 Sir John Johnson from Canada makes an incursion into Johnstown,
              New York [15]
25 May 1780 The men of the Fourth and Eighth Connecticut regiments, encamped
              in Jockey Hollow, near Morristown (NJ), mutinied and refused
              to obey orders. The soldiers were distraught from a lack of
              food and pay over the long and exceptionally hard winter,
              but were talked into discontinuing their armed protest by
              officers they respected. [7]
29 May 1780 Battle of Waxhaws: A clash between Continental Army forces
              under Abraham Buford and a mainly Loyalist force led by Banastre
              Tarleton occurs near Lancaster, South Carolina in the Waxhaws
              area (close to present-day Buford). The British destroyed the
              American forces. The British continued attacking after the
              Continentals lay down their arms, killing 113 and critically
              wounding all but 53 that remained. [2]
            The treatment of Patriot prisoners by British Colonel Banastre
              Tarleton and his Loyalist troops leads to the coining of a
              phrase that comes to define British brutality for the rest of
              the War for Independence: "Tarleton's Quarter." [12]
 6 Jun 1780 Hessian General Wilhelm Von Knyphausen, who had moved 6,000
              British and Hessian troops from Manhattan to Staten Island,
              crossed over to Elizabethtown, New Jersey, at midnight, hoping
              to push through Hobart's gap to Morristown the following
              day. Hannah Ogden Caldwell, wife of American clergyman and
              Patriot activist Reverend James Caldwell, was killed during
              his subsequent advance when a British soldier fired into her
              house in Connecticut Farms (today's Union). [7]
 7 Jun 1780 American resistance from Militia and Continentals stiffened as
              General Knyphausen moved beyond Connecticut Farms and the attack
              ground to a halt when General "Scotch Willie" Maxwell arrived
              with reinforcements and took command on the scene with more
              militiamen and the remainder of his New Jersey Brigade. Maxwell
              conducted a fighting withdrawal beyond Connecticut Farms and
              across the Rahway River towards Springfield. By nightfall on
              7 Jun, Knyphausen gave up and withdrew. [7]
20 Jun 1780 A British Officer complained in the pages of the Royal
              Gazette that the New Jersey Patriots protested too much about
              the death of Hannah Caldwell, killed when a British soldier
              fired into her house in Connecticut Farms (Union) earlier in
              the month. The officer claimed that the soldier was merely
              returning fire, and that the ultimate blame should be placed
              on the New Jersey militia for practicing guerilla warfare,
              which encouraged random return fire. [7]
            Battle of Ramsour's Mill, NC. 1,000 Tories under Lt. Col. John
              Moore and Maj. Nicholas Welch were defeated after an attack
              by 500 militiamen under Col. Francis Locke and Maj. Joseph
              McDowell. [4]
23 Jun 1780 General Knyphausen made his second incursion of the month
              into New Jersey in hopes of capturing Hobart's Gap and
              Morristown. This time he was supported by diversionary forces to
              the north. The British column moved through Connecticut farms
              but was slowed, then halted, in a stiff fight at Springfield,
              and Knyphausen withdrew once more. [7]
            The Battle of Springfield gave rise to a bit of New Jersey
              folklore, the tale of Reverend James Caldwell, a Patriot pastor
              whose wife was killed by British fire earlier in the month,
              handing out Watts hymnals on his church steps to soldiers
              for use as "wadding" in their muskets while crying "Give
              'em Watts boys." The story is best taken with more than the
              proverbial grain of salt. Continental soldiers, and by this
              stage of the war, militiamen as well, came to a fight with
              prepared musket cartridges including powder and ball wrapped
              in paper, and would likely have had no need for "wadding." [7]
              The Battle of Springfield was fought in and around Springfield,
              New Jersey (including Short Hills, formerly of Springfield,
              now of Millburn Township). [2]
 1 Jul 1780 The first meeting of the Association for Retaliation, an
              extra-legal organization created for the sole purpose of
              harassing known local Loyalists and their suspected sympathizers
              still residing in Monmouth County, was held in Freehold (NJ). The
              group pledged to use the same violent tactics employed by Tory
              refugee groups that raided the county against those perceived to
              be Loyalists, and drafted a constitution entitled "The Articles
              of Association for Purposes of Retaliation," a document that
              clearly exemplifies the principle of an "eye for an eye." [7]
11 Jul 1780 French troops arrive at Newport, RI, to aid the American cause
              [4]
21 Jul 1780 General Anthony Wayne led a raid on a Loyalist blockhouse
              at Bull's Ferry, now part of Hackensack (NJ). Although they
              outnumbered the enemy considerably, Wayne's men failed to take
              the blockhouse, and were only able to capture some cattle. [7]
            Battle of Colson's Mill, NC (close to the junction of the
              Rocky and Pee Dee Rivers). Tories defeated by Patriots under

21 Sep 1780 During the American Revolution, American General Benedict
              Arnold meets with British Major John Andre to discuss handing
              over West Point to the British, in return for the promise of a
              large sum of money and a high position in the British army. [12]
              Benedict Arnold gives the British the plans to West Point. [2]

 7 Oct 1780 King's Mountain, SC: battle lasts 65 minutes. American troops
              (and the Overmountain Men) led by Isaac Shelby and John
              Sevier defeat Maj. Patrick Ferguson and one-third of General
              Cornwallis's army [5] (credited with turning the tide of the
              war in the South). Cornwallis falls back into South Carolina. [4]

 1 Jan 1781 The Pennsylvania Line regiments of the Continental Army,
              encamped for the winter at Jockey Hollow near Morristown (NJ),

              Continental regiments routed British forces [10] under Lieutenant
              Colonel Banastre Tarleton [2] at Cowpens, South Carolina. Some
              100 British soldiers were killed, 299 wounded and 600 taken
              prisoner. 12 Americans were killed. [10]
20 Jan 1781 Soldiers of the New Jersey regiments camped at Pompton (NJ)
              mutinied, asking for the same settlement terms their fellow
              soldiers of the much larger Pennsylvania Line received. Instead,
              they were forced to surrender and the three sergeants who led
              the rebellion were executed. [7]
24 Jan 1781 Light Horse and Swamp Fox raid Georgetown, South Carolina [12]
30 Jan 1781 Maryland finally ratifies Articles of Confederation [12]
              13th state to do so. [9] The Articles of Confederation were
              first approved by the Continental Congress in 1777. Then,
              they were sent to each state for ratification. The Articles
              required unanimous ratification by the states in order to take
              effect. Some states resisted approving the Articles because
              of a dispute over western lands. A number of the states had
              large Western land holdings, while others had none. Those
              states without western holdings felt that those with holdings
              were receiving an unfair advantage. They felt that, since
              all the states had fought for independence, including the
              land to the west, it would be unfair if only the states that
              held western land would be allowed to sell them to pay off
              their war debt. Maryland continued to hold out, until 1781,
              when New York surrendered her Western claims and Virginia was
              on the verge of doing the same. [16]
 1 Feb 1781 American Brigadier General William Lee Davidson (Davidson
              College namesake) dies in combat attempting to prevent General

              American forces (4,400) and Charles, Second Earl Cornwallis'
              British forces (1,900) finally met in battle. Although the
              British claimed the field of battle, their greater losses, more
              than a quarter of the army, greatly weakened them ("Another such
              victory would destroy the British Army" - Charles James Fox). [4]

16 Aug 1781 Professed Loyalist and Pinelands bandit Joe Mulliner was hanged
              near either Pleasant Mills or Woodbury (NJ). His alleged, if
              unlikely, grave site, defined by a succession of markers over
              the years, lies alongside the Pleasant Mills/Weekstown Road. [7]

19 Oct 1781 Seige of Yorktown ends. [2] [4] Cornwallis surrounded on
              land and sea by Americans and French; [4] Cornwallis (and
              7000 of his men) surrenders, Yorktown, VA. [4] [20] After
              a long period of inactivity, the British decided to pursue
              the Southern strategy. The British were initially successful,
              but soon found themselves only in a tenuous control of coastal
              cities. After a number of tactical defeats, General Cornwallis,
              the British commander, retired to Yorktown, awaiting relief
              from the British fleet. American and French forces converged
              on him, however, and he was forced to surrender. The surrender
              at Yorktown marked the last major campaign of the war. [16]
27 Oct 1781 News of the British surrender at Yorktown on 19 Oct reached
              Trenton, where it was celebrated "with every mark of joy
              and festivity ... in the evening the whole village was
              illuminated." [7]
28 Oct 1781 The American victory at Yorktown was formally celebrated "with

              the afternoon and "brilliant illuminations" in the evening. [7]
24 Nov 1781 Patriot clergyman Reverend James Caldwell was shot and killed
              by an American sentry on duty at Elizabethtown (NJ). It was

              and he was tried and executed for murder. [7]

              of General George Washington. Asgill's mother wrote the French
              king requesting that her son be spared and Washington complied,
              defusing the situation. [7]
30 Nov 1782 Treaty of Paris: In Paris, representatives from the United States
              and the Great Britain [2] [6] sign preliminary peace articles
