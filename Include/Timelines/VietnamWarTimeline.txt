   Jul 1946 France proposes granting Vietnam limited self-government. Ho
              Chi Minh rejects the proposal and, with his organization, the
              Viet Minh, embarks on a guerrilla war against the French. [3]
 4 Aug 1953 President Dwight D. Eisenhower tells the American people the
              situation in French Indochina is "very ominous for the United

              South Vietnam [2] (backed by the North Vietnamese Communist
              Party). [1] The Viet Cong were essentially communist rebels
              in the Democratic State of South Vietnam and became known
              for their guerrilla war tactics against the Americans. [2]
       1961 The US government agreed to increase aid to South Vietnam in
              the fight against Viet Cong rebels. The agreement included

              with the backing of the United States Central Intelligence
              Agency (CIA), overthrew the regime of Ngo Dinh Diem. The US
              backed the action, since the Administration felt Diem was both
              corrupt and not pursuing the war against the Communists with
              enough vigor. US support for the action effectively deepened
              the US commitment to South Vietnam. [7]
11 Jun 1963 Self immolation of Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc in Saigon
              sparks outrage around the world and brings attention to the

              first American to be taken prisoner by North Vietnam. [3]
