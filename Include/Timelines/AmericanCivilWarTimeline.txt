       1861 Fort Sumter refused to surrender to the Confederates. Sixty-eight
              soldiers under the command of Major Anderson had been in the fort
              from 26 Dec, without supplies. When Lincoln made the decision
              to resupply the fort, the Confederacy decided to assault it. In
              the middle of the night of the 12th, Confederate emissaries
              brought Major Anderson an ultimatum: surrender by 4:00 AM or
              be fired upon. At 4:30 AM on the 12th, General Pierre Gustave
              Toutant Beauregard gave the order to open fire. The next
              afternoon Major Anderson surrendered. The war was on. [1]

              privates for single men and $6 a month to men with wives or
              widowed mothers. As the federal pay of private soldiers rose,
              state pay to individuals was ended, but dependent pay remained
              in effect to the end of the war. New Jersey's regular army and
              navy personnel and African-American soldiers serving in the

21 Jul 1861 The Battle of Bull Run (or First Manassas), is fought near
              Manassas, Virginia. The Union Army under General Irwin McDowell
              initially succeeds in driving back Confederate forces under
              General Pierre Gustav Toutant Beauregard, but the arrival of
              troops under General Joseph E. Johnston initates a series of
              reverses that sends McDowell's army in a panicked retreat to
              the defenses of Washington. It is here that Thomas Jonathan
              Jackson, a professor at VMI, will receive everlasting fame as
              "Stonewall" Jackson. [7]
25 Jul 1861 The United States Congress passes the Crittenden-Johnson

              Revenue Act of 1861 [4] (3% of all incomes over US$800; [4]
              [5] rescinded in 1872). [4]

 7 Aug 1861 General Philip Kearny, one armed New Jersey hero of the
              Mexican War, assumed command of the First New Jersey Brigade
              in Virginia. The ill-disciplined brigade's first meeting
              with its new commander was not auspicious, as he found the
              Jerseymen looting a peach orchard. After placing all the
              officers under arrest, Kearny met with them and laid out his
              disciplinary guidelines. Over the winter of 1861-1862, the
              general's training regimen turned the brigade into a first
              class outfit, a reputation it maintained through the close of
              the war. Kearny never commanded the Jerseymen in combat, though,
              leaving for division command before the Peninsula Campaign. [9]
10 Aug 1861 Battle of Wilson's Creek, Missouri. [4] [7] [8] The Union
              Army under General Nathaniel Lyon, attack Confederate troops

              after a disastrous day that included the death of Lyon, are
              thrown back. The Confederate victory emphasizes the strong
              southern presence west of the Mississippi River. [8] This
              is the first major engagement of the Civil War west of the
              Mississippi River. [8]
14 Aug 1861 As New Jersey's response to the outbreak of the Civil War
              picked up in response to a third call for troops, the New
              York Times reported that "Camp Olden, so named after the
              respected and popular Governor of the State of New-Jersey
              [Charles Olden], promises soon to be the arena once more of a
              fine body of troops, as the five regiments now called for by
              the Government will begin soon to master at the camp." [9]
28 Aug 1861 Union forces attack Cape Hatteras, North Carolina in the Battle

              naval forces. This begins the first Union efforts to close
              southern ports along the Carolina coast. [7]

              (and its only woman officer) by the Confederate US Army. [3]

17 Sep 1861 Mary Smith Peake, the daughter of a white Englishman and a
              free woman of color, began teaching the runaway slaves under

              American school for freed slaves. The tree became known as
              the Emancipation Oak after Pres. Lincoln's Emancipation
              Proclamation was read there in 1863. [6]

              led troops across the Potomac River only to be forced back to
              the river's edge where he [7] was killed. [4] [7] The ensuing
              Union withdrawal turned into a rout with many soldiers drowning

              the track. 8 of the 24 raiders were hanged that summer. 8 others
              escaped and made their way north. The episode inspired Buster
              Keaton's 1927 comedy "The General." In 1956 Disney retold the

              8th Regiment, who was killed at the battle of Williamsburg.
              He was unable to get it however, Gen. McClellan having issued
              orders that no bodies should be exhumed till further orders from
              him. Bodies which had reached Yorktown and Fortress Monroe on
              the way home were stopped and buried there. An undertaker from

              one missing in action. [9] In the aftermath of the Confederate
              victory at Manassas, General Lee led his army into Maryland -
              in a gamble to win the war. His plans fell into Union hands,
              and the Union army massed against him outside a little town
              in Maryland, called Sharpsburg, near the Antietam Creek. In
              a day long battle, 23,582 Americans became casualties. Both
              sides lost an equal number of men. The Confederate force,
              which was much smaller, however, was forced to withdraw. In
              the aftermath of the battle, considered to be a Union victory,
              Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation. [1]

              of the Civil War, it also marks the beginning of the Gettysburg
              Campaign. Meanwhile, the Union assault on Vicksburg, Mississippi
              has become a siege of the city where soldiers and civilians
              alike suffer from constant bombardment. [8]

              invasion. In the event, a few companies of volunteer militia
              were formed, but never left the state. Many of the men of the
              Twenty-third New Jersey Infantry, veterans of Fredericksburg
              and Salem Church, who were in Beverley awaiting discharge after
              completion of nine months' service, did respond, however. These
              Jerseymen followed their commander, Colonel E. Burd Grubb,
              to Harrisburg, where they dug trenches along the Susquehanna
              River. The men of the Twenty-third returned home after the
              crisis passed, many grumbling that the Pennsylvanians did not
              appreciate their efforts. [9]

              near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. [7]
29 Jun 1863 George Armstrong Custer, aged 23, appointed Union Brigadier
              General. [3]
 1 Jul 1863 The Battle of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania begins. [4] [7] [8] [11]
              The bloodiest battle of the Civil War dashes Robert E. Lee's
              hopes for a successful invasion of the North. [7] The Battle
              of Gettysburg took place around this small Pennsylvania town,
              when Confederate forces foraging for shoes encountered a Union
              cavalry brigade guarding the town. Both sides quickly brought
              their main units to bear. In the first day of the battle,
              Confederate troops forced Union forces back, but at a very heavy
              cost. The second day, Confederates attacked heavily fortified
              Union positions, and were repulsed on every attempt. Finally,
              on the third day, Lee's forces attempted to attack the Union
              Center. The attack was called "Pickett's Charge." Less than
              half of the men involved in the charge returned. Gettysburg
              marked the last time the Confederates attempted to bring about
              a decisive battle on Union soil. [1]
 2 Jul 1863 At the battle of Gettysburg, the Newark boys of New Jersey's
              Artillery Battery B, deployed near the Peach Orchard, fired
              1,342 rounds, more than any other Union artillery battery
              in the Civil War fired in a single day - and Battery B's day
              started at 2:00 p.m. As the Union Third Army Corps retreated,
              Battery B successfully disengaged from advancing Rebels and
              managed to withdraw all six of its guns to Cemetery Ridge. [9]
            New Jersey's 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 11th Infantry regiments
              were also involved in heavy action that day, from Plum Run
              through the Wheatfield to the north of the Peach Orchard,
              with the 11th staging an epic fighting withdrawal from the
              Emmitsburg Road to Cemetery Ridge. [9]
 3 Jul 1863 The men of the Twelfth New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, firing
              "buck and ball" ammunition (one round ball and three buck shot)
              in their obsolete smoothbore muskets, helped wreck Pickett's
              Charge on Cemetery Ridge. Some of the New Jerseyans took their
              paper cartridges apart and loaded as many as twenty buckshot
              pellets in their muskets. As the Rebels closed on the federal
              line, the Twenty-sixth North Carolina regiment drifted towards
              the Twelfth's position. The Jerseymen rose up from behind the
              stone wall they were using for cover and delivered a crushing
              short range volley into the Carolinians, devastating the
              regiment and capturing its flag, which hung in Trenton until
              returned to North Carolina in the early 20th century. [9]
            On the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederate General
              Robert E. Lee's last attempt at breaking the Union line ends
              in disastrous failure, [2] bringing the most decisive battle
              of the American Civil War to an end. [2] [11]
 4 Jul 1863 Vicksburg, Mississippi, surrenders to the Union Army under
              Grant. The capture of Vicksburg gives the Union complete
              control of the Mississippi River, a vital supply line for the
              Confederate states in the west. At Gettysburg, Lee begins his
              retreat to Virginia. [7]
            The Army of Northern Virginia withdraws from the battlefield
              after losing the Battle of Gettysburg, signalling an end to
              the Confederate invasion of U.S. territory. [4]
            Siege of Vicksburg: Vicksburg, Mississippi surrenders to
              U.S. forces under Ulysses S. Grant after 47 days of siege. One
              hundred fifty miles up the Mississippi River, a Confederate
              army is repulsed at the Battle of Helena, Arkansas. [4]
 7 Jul 1863 Orders barring Jews from serving under US General Ulysses

              control of the Mississippi River. [4]

              Charleston, South Carolina. Among the Union troops is the 54th
              Massachusetts Colored Infantry, the first African American
              regiment of volunteers to see combat. [7]
13 Jul 1863 Draft Riots begin in New York City and elsewhere as disgruntled
              workers and laborers, seething over the draft system that
              seemingly favors the rich, attack the draft office and African
              American churches. [4] [7] (The rioters in New York are against
              law that says $300 lets one avoid the draft during which they
              burn an orphanage.) [5] The riots continue through 16 Jul
              [7] and later will be regarded as the worst in United States
              history. [4]
            Near Falling Waters, Maryland, Union troops skirmish with
              Lee's rearguard. That night the Army of Northern Virginia

              Infantry, [4] [7] supported by several white regiments, attempts
              an unsuccessful assault on Confederate-held Battery Wagner. [4]
              Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (commander of the 54th, [7] b. 1837)
              [4] is killed and buried with the dead of his regiment. [7]
19 Jul 1863 Morgan's Raid: At Buffington Island in Ohio, Confederate General
              John Hunt Morgan's raid into the north is mostly thwarted when
              a large group of his men are captured while trying to escape
              across the Ohio River. [4]
26 Jul 1863 Morgan's Raid ends; At Salineville, Ohio, Confederate cavalry
              leader John Hunt Morgan and 360 of his volunteers are captured
              by Union forces. [4]

19 Sep 1863 The first day of [4] the Battle of Chickamauga, Georgia. The
              Union Army of the Cumberland under General William Rosecrans is
              defeated and nearly routed by the Confederate Army of Tennessee

              partially submerged, steam powered vessel, attacked the New
              Ironsides, part of the Union fleet blockading the harbor,
              with a torpedo. Both ships survived the attack, though the
              commander of the David and one of his crew were captured. [7]
 9 Oct 1863 Bristoe Station Campaign begins. In a feint toward Washington,
              Lee's Army of the Northern Virginia marches into northern
              Virginia in an attempt to flank the Army of the Potomac, under
              General Meade. Lee successfully outmaneuvers Meade though
              fails to bring him to battle or catch him in the open. An
              engagement at Bristoe Station, Virginia, on 14 Oct gives the
              campaign its name. [7]
14 Oct 1863 Confederate troops under the command of A. P. Hill fail to
              drive the Union Army completely out of Virginia. [4]

23 Nov 1863 The Battle for Chattanooga. Union forces [4] [7] led by
              General Ulysses S. Grant [4] break the Confederate siege
              of the city in successive attacks. The most notable event
              is the storming of Lookout Mountain on 24 Nov and Battle of
              Missionary Ridge the following day. The decisive Union victory
              sends the Confederate Army south into Georgia where General
              Bragg reorganizes his forces before resigning from command on
              30 Nov. [7] The Thirty-third New Jersey regiment was heavily
              engaged in its first battle. Lieutenant John Toffey was badly
              wounded and awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism that
              day. As an officer in the Veteran Reserve Corps, Toffey was

              against Lee's Army of Northern Virginia south of the Rapidan
              River, east of Orange Court House. Lee reacts and throws up
              a line of defenses along the banks of Mine Run Creek. After
              several days of probing the defenses, Meade withdraws north
              of the Rapidan and goes into winter quarters. [7]
27 Nov 1863 Siege of Knoxville, Tennessee begins. Confederate troops
              under General James Longstreet lay siege to the city
              of Knoxville held by Union forces under General Ambrose
              Burnside. Longstreet finally attacks on 30 Nov but is repulsed
              with heavy losses. The arrival of Union reinforcements forces
              him to withdraw to Greeneville, Tennessee, where his corps
              will spend the winter. [7]
            Confederate cavalry leader John Hunt Morgan and several of
              his men escape the Ohio Penitentiary and return safely to the
              South. [4]
            Battle of Mine Run: Union forces under General George Meade
              take up positions against troops led by Confederate General
              Robert E. Lee. [4]
29 Nov 1863 Battle of Fort Sanders: Union forces under Ambrose Burnside
              successfully defend Knoxville, Tennessee from Confederate
              forces under James Longstreet. [4]
 3 Dec 1863 Confederate General James Longstreet abandons his siege at
              Knoxville, TN. [3]
 8 Dec 1863 Lincoln Issues his Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction,
              which would pardon those who participated in the "existing
              rebellion" if they take an oath to the Union. [7]
16 Dec 1863 Joseph E. Johnston replaces Braxton Bragg as commander of the
              Confederate Army of Tennessee. [4]
31 Dec 1863 Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Buchanan, the federal government's
              Acting Assistant Provost Marshal General for New Jersey under
              the Enrollment Act of 1863, ordered recruiting officers to
              enlist "all suitable colored men who may offer themselves for
              enlistment." Township recruiters, hired brokers who had been
              recruiting white soldiers and received a fee for every man
              they enlisted against a municipality's draft quota, didn't
              wait for black men to offer themselves, and began to actively
              pursue New Jersey African-American volunteers to serve in
              the state's name in the United States Colored Troops. By the
              end of the Civil War, 2,902 New Jersey African-Americans had
              served in United States Colored Troops units and another 362
              in the United States Navy. [9]
            Battle of Stones River, Tennessee. Fought between the Union
              Army of the Cumberland under General William Rosecrans and the
              Confederate Army of Tennessee under General Braxton Bragg, the
              costly Union victory frees middle Tennessee from Confederate
              control and boosts northern morale. [7]
 8 Jan 1864 David O. Dodd (17), an Arkansas teenage spy, was hanged by
              Union forces on the grounds of his former school. He reportedly
              chose to hang rather than betray the Confederate cause. [6]
 5 Feb 1864 Federals occupy Jackson, Mississippi. [3]
 9 Feb 1864 Escape from Libby Prison, Richmond. After weeks of digging, 109
              Union officers made their escape from the notorious Libby Prison,
              the largest and most sensational escape of the war. Though 48
              of the escapees were later captured and two drowned, 59 were
              able to make their way into Union lines. [7]
14 Feb 1864 Union Capture and Occupation of Meridian, Mississippi
              begins. Union forces under William T. Sherman enter the
              city of Meridian, Mississippi after a successful month of
              campaigning through the central part of the state. The capture
              of this important southern town, well known for its industry
              and storage capabilities, severely hampers the efforts of
              Confederate commanders to sustain their armies in the deep
              south, Georgia and west of the Mississippi River. [7]
17 Feb 1864 First Successful Submarine Attack of the Civil War. The CSS
              H.L. Hunley, a seven-man submergible craft, attacked the USS
              Houstonic outside of Charleston, South Carolina. Struck by
              the submarine's torpedo, the Housatonic broke apart and sank,
              taking all but five of her crew with her. Likewise, the Hunley
              was also lost and never heard from again until discovered in
              1995 at the spot where it sank after the attack. [7]
20 Feb 1864 Battle of Olustee: The largest battle fought in Florida during
              the war. [4]
27 Feb 1864 In Georgia, Camp Sumter Prison Camp opens. Universally referred
              to as Andersonville Prison Camp, it will become notorious
              for overcrowded conditions and a high death rate among its
              inmates. [7]
29 Feb 1864 Kilpatrick-Dahlgren Raid fails: Plans to free 15,000 Union
              soldiers being held near Richmond, Virginia are thwarted. [4]
 2 Mar 1864 Ulysses S. Grant is appointed lieutenant general, a rank revived
              at the request of President Lincoln. Grant assumes command of
              all Union Armies 10 Mar. [7]
10 Mar 1864 The Red River Campaign begins. As part of an overall Union
              strategy to strike deep into various parts of the Confederacy, a
              combined force of army and navy commands under General Nathaniel
              Banks begins a campaign on the Red River in Louisiana. [7]
            President Abraham Lincoln assigns Ulysses S. Grant, who has
              just received his commission as lieutenant general, to command
              the U.S.Army. [8]
12 Mar 1864 The Red River Campaign begins as a US Navy fleet of 13 Ironclads
              and 7 Gunboats and other support ships enter the Red River. [4]
            Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assumes command as General-in-Chief
              of the Union armies in the Civil War. [8]
15 Mar 1864 The Red River Campaign: U.S. Navy fleet arrives at Alexandria,
              Louisiana. [4]
16 Mar 1864 During the Red River Campaign, Union troops reach Alexandria,
              Louisiana. [4]
 8 Apr 1864 Battle of Sabine Crossroads or Mansfield, Louisiana, the
              first major battle of the Red River Campaign in Louisiana;
              [7] Confederates rout Union. [2]
            Battle of Mansfield: Union forces are thwarted by the Confederate
              army at Mansfield, Louisiana. [4]
            The United States Senate passes, 38-6, the 13th Amendment
              to the U.S. Constitution abolishing slavery. (The House of
              Representatives would pass it in Jan 1865; the amendment would
              be ratified and adopted in Dec 1865.) [8]
 9 Apr 1864 Battle of Pleasant Hill, Louisiana. The Union Army under
              Banks defeats the attempt by Confederate forces under General
              Richard Taylor to drive them out of Louisiana. Unfortunately,
              the result of the campaign would be less than desired as it
              drew to a close in the first week of May with Confederates
              still in firm control of most of the state. [7]
12 Apr 1864 Capture of Fort Pillow, Tennessee. After a rapid raid through
              central and western Tennessee, Confederate cavalry under Nathan
              Bedford Forrest attacked and overwhelmed the Union garrison
              at Fort Pillow, located on the Mississippi River. Among those
              garrisoning the fort were African American troops, many of whom
              were murdered by Forrest's angered troopers after they had
              surrendered. The affair was investigated and though charges
              of an atrocity were denied by Confederate authorities, the
              events at Fort Pillow cast a pall over Forrest's reputation
              and remained an emotional issue throughout the remainder of
              the war and after. [7]
17 Apr 1864 The Battle of Plymouth begins: Confederate forces attack
              Plymouth, North Carolina. [4]
18 Apr 1864 At Poison Spring, Arkansas, Confederate soldiers under the
              command of General Samuel Maxey capture a Union forage train
              and slaughter black troops escorting the expedition. [2]
25 Apr 1864 The Battle of Marks' Mills. [4]
 4 May 1864 Battle of the Wilderness, Virginia, the opening battle of the
              "Overland Campaign" or "Wilderness Campaign". General Ulysses
              S. Grant, accompanying the Army of the Potomac under General
              Meade, issued orders for the campaign to begin on 3 May. Lee
              responded by attacking the Union column in the dense woods
              and underbrush of an area known as the Wilderness, west of
              Fredericksburg, Virginia. [7]
 7 May 1864 Beginning of the Atlanta Campaign. With three Union armies
              under his command, General William T. Sherman marched south
              from Tennessee into Georgia against the Confederate Army of
              Tennessee under General Joseph Johnston, the objective being
              the city of Atlanta. [7]
            Battle of Wilderness ends (total losses: USA-17,666; CSA-7,500).
              [3]
            The Army of the Potomac, under General Ulysses S. Grant, breaks
              off from the Battle of the Wilderness and moves southwards. [4]
 8 May 1864 Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Virginia begins. Lee
              successfully stalls Grant's drive toward Richmond. [7]
 9 May 1864 Union troops take Snake Creek Gap, Georgia. [2]
            Union General John Sedgwick was shot and killed by a confederate
              sharpshooter during fighting at Spotsylvania, Va. His last words
              before getting hit were "From this distance they couldn't hit
              an elephant." [6]
10 May 1864 Colonel Emory Upton leads a 10-regiment "Attack-in-depth"
              assault against the Confederate works at The Battle of
              Spotsylvania, which, though ultimately unsuccessful, would
              provide the idea for the massive assault against the Bloody
              Angle on 12 May. Upton is slightly wounded but is immediately
              promoted to brigadier general. [4]
11 May 1864 Battle of Yellow Tavern. Six miles north of Richmond, Confederate
              cavalry under General J.E.B. Stuart blocked a force of Union
              cavalry under General Philip Sheridan. General Stuart was
              mortally wounded during the encounter. [7]
12 May 1864 Colonel William Penrose's First New Jersey Brigade, the
              Second, Third, Fourth and Fifteenth New Jersey regiments
              and four companies of the Second New Jersey regiment (six
              companies of the Second were deployed on picket duty and the
              Tenth New Jersey was on detached duty) attacked Confederates
              at the "Bloody Angle" at Spotsylvania, Virginia, suffering
              heavy casualties. In two weeks of fighting at Spotsylvania,
              which began on 8 May, the brigade suffered 789 casualties,
              most of them on 12 May. The Fifteenth New Jersey lost 272 men
              killed, wounded and missing at Spotsylvania, a total exceeded
              by only one other Union regiment at the battle, the 148th
              Pennsylvania. Only one other federal regiment, the Fifth New
              York at Second Bull Run, lost more men killed in a single
              battle than the Fifteenth in the Civil War. [9]
            The Battle of Spotsylvania Court House: Union troops assault a
              Confederate salient known as the "Mule Shoe", with the fiercest
              fighting of the war, much of it hand-to-hand combat, occurring
              at "the Bloody Angle" on the northwest. [4]
13 May 1864 Battle of Resaca: The battle begins with Union General Sherman
              fighting toward Atlanta. [4]
14 May 1864 Battle of Resaca, Georgia. General Sherman's armies are blocked
              at Resaca by General Johnston's Army of Tennessee. After two days
              of maneuvering and intense fighting, Johnston withdraws. Sherman
              will advance but take precautions against ordering any further
              massed assaults where high casualties may occur. [7]
15 May 1864 Battle of New Market, Virginia: [3] [4] Students from the
              Virginia Military Institute fight alongside the Confederate
              army to force Union General Franz Sigel out of the Shenandoah
              Valley. [4]
20 May 1864 Battle of Ware Bottom Church: In the Virginia Bermuda Hundred
              Campaign, 10,000 troops fight in this Confederate victory. [4]
21 May 1864 The Battle of Spotsylvania Court House ends. [4]
22 May 1864 After ten weeks, the Union Army's Red River Campaign ends in
              failure. [4]
31 May 1864 Overland Campaign: Battle of Cold Harbor: The Army of Northern
              Virginia engages the Army of the Potomac. [4]
 1 Jun 1864 Battle of Cold Harbor, Virginia begins. Relentless and bloody
              Union attacks fail to dislodge Lee's army from its strong line
              of defensive works northeast of Richmond. [7]
 3 Jun 1864 Battle of Cold Harbor: Union forces attack Confederate troops
              in Hanover County, Virginia. [4]
 5 Jun 1864 Battle of Piedmont: Union forces under General David Hunter
              defeat a Confederate army at Piedmont, Virginia, taking nearly
              1,000 prisoners. [4]
10 Jun 1864 Battle of Brice's Crossroads, Mississippi. In spite of being
              outnumbered almost two to one, Confederate General Nathan
              Bedford Forrest attacks and routs the Union command under
              General Samuel Sturgis. [4] [7]
12 Jun 1864 Overland Campaign: Battle of Cold Harbor: Ulysses S. Grant
              gives the Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee a victory when
              he pulls his Union troops from their position at Cold Harbor,
              Virginia and moves south. [4]
13 Jun 1864 The US Sanitary Commission, a charitable organization dedicated
              to assisting hospitalized Union soldiers, opened its "Great
              Central Fair" in Philadelphia. Many state organizations had
              displays relating to the war, history, technology and other
              attractions, including food booths, with all proceeds to go
              to the Sanitary Commission's charitable work. The New Jersey
              chapter operated a "cosy [sic] little room fitted up for
              the convenience of smokers" called the "Turkish Divan." It
              was equipped with "lounges covered with red damask" where,
              for ten cents, one could stretch out and enjoy a "fragrant
              Havana." It apparently did a considerable amount of business. [9]
15 Jun 1864 Assault on Petersburg, Virginia begins. [3] [7] After
              withdrawing from the lines at Cold Harbor, the Army of the
              Potomac crossed the James River and with troops from the
              Army of the James attacked the outer defenses of Petersburg,
              the primary junction for several southern railroads. After
              four days of bloody attacks, Grant accepts that only a siege
              can systematically isolate the city and cut off Confederate
              supplies to the capital of Richmond. [7] The Twenty-second
              United States Colored Infantry, a regiment composed mostly
              of New Jersey African-American soldiers, was part of a force
              that broke through the Confederate defenses of Petersburg. The
              Twenty-second captured an enemy fort and artillery pieces, but
              their army corps commander, Major General William F. "Baldy"
              Smith, halted the victorious advance. When Confederate
              reinforcements arrived, Petersburg was saved and a ten month
              siege of the critical rail junction began. [9]
18 Jun 1864 The Thirty-fifth New Jersey Infantry charged a Confederate
              position at Big Shanty, Georgia, capturing a line of rifle pits
              and fifty prisoners. Brigadier General Grenville M. Dodge noted
              in his official report that "in this charge the Thirty-fifth
              New Jersey Infantry displayed great gallantry." [9]
19 Jun 1864 The USS Kearsarge sinks the Confederate raider CSS Alabama
              near Cherbourg, France. [7]
21 Jun 1864 The Battle of Jerusalem Plank Road begins. [4]
23 Jun 1864 The Thirty-seventh New Jersey Infantry was mustered into
              the army for 100 days service. The men of the regiment were
              described by a Newark newspaper as '... many with only one eye;
              several with less fingers than the regulations allowed; a few,
              long since past the age at which military service terminates; and
              scores of mere boys from fifteen years of age upwards." Perhaps
              surprisingly, the regiment's men did not do badly on trench
              duty in Virginia, and on expiration of their service, Brigadier
              General William Birney declared them "good soldiers," who
              "have gained the esteem of the veterans of this corps." [9]
27 Jun 1864 Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, Georgia. After weeks of maneuvering
              and battles, Sherman's Army of the Cumberland and Army of the
              Tennessee smash headlong into Johnston's carefully planned
              defenses at Big and Little Kennesaw. Johnston remains on this
              line until 2 Jul, when he retreats at the threat of being
              flanked by Sherman's mobile force. [7]
 9 Jul 1864 Battle of Monocacy, Maryland. In an attempt to draw Union
              troops away from the ongoing siege of Petersburg and Richmond,
              a Confederate force under Jubal Early quietly moved north into
              Maryland. Early had made excellent progress until he reached
              Frederick, Maryland, where a force of 6,000 Federal troops under
              General Lew Wallace, was arrayed to delay his advance. Though
              the battle was a Union defeat, it was also touted as "the battle
              that saved Washington" for it succeeded in holding back Early's
              march until troops could be sent to the capital's defense. [7]
11 Jul 1864 Attack on the Defenses of Washington. [4] [7] Jubal Early's
              troops arrive on the outskirts of Washington, DC, and trade
              cannon fire with a token Union force remaining in the forts
              around the city. President Lincoln observes the skirmishing from
              Fort Stevens as reinforcements from the Army of the Potomac
              arrive and quickly fill in the works. Early withdraws that
              evening. [7]
14 Jul 1864 Battles near Tupelo, Mississippi. The Union defeat of Nathan
              Bedford Forrest secured the supply lines to Sherman's armies
              operating against Atlanta, Georgia. [7]
17 Jul 1864 General John Bell Hood replaces General Joseph Johnston as
              commander of the Army of Tennessee. This change in command
              signals a new Confederate strategy to thwart Sherman's campaign,
              though the end result will be disastrous for the southern
              cause. [7]
20 Jul 1864 Battle of Peachtree Creek: Near Atlanta, Georgia, Confederate
              forces led by General John Bell Hood unsuccessfully attack
              Union troops under General William T. Sherman. [4] [7] After
              several hours of fierce fighting, Hood withdrew back to his
              own defensive works. [7]
21 Jul 1864 The Battle of Atlanta. Hood's second effort to throw back
              Union forces under Sherman brings him heavy casualties with
              no positive results. General James McPherson, commander of the
              Union Army of the Tennessee, is killed during the fighting. [7]
22 Jul 1864 Battle of Atlanta: Outside Atlanta, Confederate General John
              Bell Hood leads an unsuccessful attack on Union troops under
              General William T. Sherman on Bald Hill. [4]
24 Jul 1864 Battle of Kernstown: Confederate General Jubal Early defeats
              Union troops led by General George Crook in an effort to keep
              them out of the Shenandoah Valley. [4]
28 Jul 1864 Battle of Ezra Church: Confederate troops make a third
              unsuccessful attempt to drive Union forces from Atlanta,
              Georgia. [4]
29 Jul 1864 Confederate spy Belle Boyd is arrested by Union troops and
              detained at the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C. [4]
30 Jul 1864 The Battle of the Crater at Petersburg, Virginia. After a month
              of tunneling by soldiers of the 48th Pennsylvania Infantry,
              a massive mine was exploded under a Confederate fort in the
              Petersburg siege lines. The infantry charge that followed was
              poorly coordinated and by day's end, Confederate counterattacks
              had driven out the Union troops and the siege lines remained
              unchanged. [7]
31 Jul 1864 Ulysses S. Grant is named General of Volunteers. [3]
 1 Aug 1864 Sheridan takes command of Army of the Shenandoah. [2]
 5 Aug 1864 Battle of Mobile Bay. A Union fleet under Admiral David Farragut
              steamed into Mobile Bay outside the city of Mobile, Alabama,
              defended by two strong forts and a small southern flotilla,
              including the formidable ironclad CSS Tennessee. Farragut's
              ships defeated the Confederate ships and bypassed the forts,
              capturing the important southern port. [7] "Damn the torpedoes,
              full speed ahead!" [3]
17 Aug 1864 Battle of Gainesville: Confederate forces defeat Union troops
              near Gainesville, Florida. [4]
18 Aug 1864 Battle of Globe Tavern: [4] Battles on the Weldon Railroad

              it was the largest battle fought in the Shenandoah Valley. [4]
22 Sep 1864 Battle of Fisher's Hill, Virginia. The Union Army of the
              Shenandoah under General Philip Sheridan attacked Jubal Early's
              Confederates near Fisher's Hill, overpowering the southerners
              and again forcing them to flee the battlefield. Union officers

              border with the intent of robbing three banks and burning the
              town. While they managed to leave town and hide out in Canada
              with more than $200,000, their attempts to burn down the town
              failed. Most of the raiders were captured and imprisoned in

              in St. Albans were acts of war. [6]

              Federal line meets with disaster. Despite some taking of

              by a "torpedo," or land mine, buried in a road near Savannah,
              Georgia by retreating Confederates. Williams bears the dubious
              distinction of probably being the first New Jerseyan killed

              the rest of the mines in the road. [9]

              the question of readmission was moot. The Congress had other
              ideas and passed a series of laws imposing military control
              over the South. [1]
